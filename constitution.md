# Constitution

The governing rules for spec-driven software development. This document defines the principles, workflow, and quality gates that apply to every project regardless of tech stack.

<!-- §principles -->

## Guiding Principles

These are evaluation criteria, not implementation instructions. Use them to identify gaps or violations, not to drive design decisions.

### Technology

- **Secure:** protect sensitive data through industry standards and best practices. See `specs/rules/security-backend.md` and `specs/rules/security-frontend.md` for enforceable rules.
- **Scalable:** design and implement to be dynamically scaled
- **Learnable:** fast onboarding through clear patterns, documentation, and accessible codebase design
- **Reliable:** graceful degradation and automatic recovery when components fail
- **Recordable:** accurate, durable data capture for business metrics, audit trails, and event tracing
- **Supportable:** simple and quick to detect, identify, and resolve issues
- **Automated:** humans only do what computers can't
- **Testable:** design for security, unit, functional, and load testing
- **Consumable:** simple and intuitive interfaces into our systems
- **Verified:** nothing reaches production without validation

### Business

- **Fast:** responsive systems, short time to market, rapid updates and fixes
- **Serviceable:** solutions exist to serve identified needs, not to justify themselves
- **Evolvable:** the business can adapt, grow, and create products and services as needs change
- **Flexible:** customers are served by products and services that fit their varied needs
- **Observable:** clear, real-time visibility into product and service performance
- **Compliant:** meet regulatory, legal, and industry requirements
- **Cost-conscious:** optimize cost across building, operating, and scaling products and services

<!-- §cost-levers -->

### Cost levers

Per-task token tracking and budget ceilings require a runtime `govern` does not have — that work belongs to the AI platform. `govern` contributes by offering cost-aware patterns the user can opt into. The current levers: the stuck-detection step in `/papur:implement` catches runaway loops before they compound spend; default-off autonomy keeps the human in the loop unless `--auto` is explicitly passed. For runtime cost controls, point the adopter at the platform's tooling — Claude Code's `/cost`, the Anthropic usage dashboard, Cursor's request limits, and equivalents.

<!-- §pipeline -->

## Development Pipeline

Every feature follows the pipeline: **spec → plan → tasks → implement**. No code is written without a spec. No implementation begins without a plan.

<!-- §spec-phase -->

### Spec Phase

Define *what* the feature does and *why*. A spec captures requirements, contracts, and constraints without prescribing implementation details.

Each feature lives in a numbered directory under `specs/`:

```text
specs/
  system.md              # Architecture, shared conventions
  events.md              # Global event catalog
  errors.md              # Error handling conventions
  {NNN-feature}/
    spec.md              # Requirements, contracts, acceptance criteria
    research.md          # (optional) Background research, prior art
    plan.md              # Implementation approach, technical decisions
    data-model.md        # (optional) Domain entities and data structures, generated during plan phase
    tasks.md             # Discrete work items derived from the plan
    scenarios/           # (optional) Scenario files elaborating spec sections
      {slug}.md          # One file per scenario
```

<!-- §spec-requirements -->

#### Spec requirements

- Every spec includes a **Status** indicator: `draft`, `clarified`, `planned`, `in-progress`, or `done`
- Every spec includes **Acceptance Criteria** — concrete, testable conditions that define "done"
- Every spec includes **Open Questions** — uncertainties and unresolved decisions
- Every spec lists **Dependencies** — other specs this feature depends on
- Open questions must be resolved before moving to the plan phase
- Specs describe behavior and contracts, not implementation

<!-- §spec-lifecycle -->

#### Spec lifecycle

| Status | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| `draft` | Initial spec written, may have unresolved open questions |
| `clarified` | All open questions resolved, acceptance criteria are concrete and testable |
| `planned` | Plan and tasks exist, readiness check passed |
| `in-progress` | Implementation has started |
| `done` | All acceptance criteria verified, code merged |

```text
draft ──/clarify──▶ clarified ──/plan──▶ planned ──/implement──▶ in-progress ──[/review gate]──▶ done
```

Forward edges only — `/clarify` raises status to `clarified`, `/plan` to `planned`, `/implement` to `in-progress` and then to `done`. The `in-progress → done` transition is gated by `/review`: `/implement` MUST NOT write `status: done` while the spec's `review.last-run` is unset or `review.blocking` is `true`. `/review` is a gate, not a state transition — it records findings and updates the `review:` frontmatter block, but does not change `status`. The gate composes with `/analyze` (which flags drifted `done` specs) and the shipped CI template (which fails PRs that bypass the local checks) per the **Design Principles** rule: never depend on human diligence. Three back-edges exist:

- **Backward via new questions** — `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` → `draft` when `/amend` records a new open question; the next `/clarify` resolves the question and the spec advances forward again. `draft` is the only status that tolerates open questions, so it is the destination; `/amend` performs the status mutation in the same write that records the question.
- **Backward via new scenario** — `done` → `in-progress` when `/amend` records a scenario. The scenario's task is implemented and the spec returns to `done`.
- **Backward via meaningful body edit** — `done` → `in-progress` when any artifact under `specs/{feature}/` is edited *meaningfully*. An edit is **mechanical** (no back-edge) in either of two diff-determinable cases: **(a)** every change in the diff is the same find-and-replace token substitution, applied uniformly across all live artifacts per the `AGENTS.md` rename rule's scope, mapping a deprecated label (slug, capability, command, identifier, parenthetical descriptor) to its current label; or **(b)** every change in the diff adds, removes, or rewrites a **cross-service reference** — an inline body link whose target resolves to a registered `.govern.toml` `[services]` entry, together with the regenerated `references:` frontmatter that harvests it — because such references are informative cross-service navigation, never dependencies, acceptance criteria, or behavior (spec 030). Anything else — new scope, changed semantics, factual corrections, restructuring, edits scoped to a single spec — is a **meaningful edit** and triggers the back-edge via the same `/amend` flow used for scenarios. The distinction is determinable from the diff alone, so the rule does not depend on author judgment.

This avoids spec proliferation; scenarios evolve the existing spec rather than spawning a new one. Spec bodies are living documents that represent current state — git history is the historical record of what was written when.

#### The three cycles

Every spec moves through one of three cycles depending on where it starts and whether new behavior surfaces:

1. **Greenfield** — `/specify` → `/clarify` → `/plan` → `/implement` → `done`. A new feature designed from scratch.
2. **Brownfield** — `/specify` (sketch spec — sparse acceptance criteria are valid) → real work touches the area → `/amend` to add a scenario, or `/clarify` to resolve open questions, or both → `/implement` → `done`. Existing reality being absorbed into specs incrementally.
3. **Reopen** — a `done` spec is revisited because a bug, edge case, or change request surfaces. `/amend` records a scenario, the spec moves back to `in-progress`, and the next pipeline command resumes from there.

All three converge on the same pipeline; what differs is where the spec enters and how precision accumulates.

<!-- §plan-phase -->

### Plan Phase

Define *how* the feature will be implemented. A plan makes technical decisions, identifies affected files, and considers trade-offs.

#### Plan requirements

- References the spec it implements
- Lists technical decisions and their rationale
- Identifies affected files and packages
- Addresses all open questions from the spec
- Produces a data model if the feature introduces or modifies domain entities or data structures

<!-- §tasks-phase -->

### Tasks Phase

Break the plan into discrete, ordered work items. Each task is small enough to implement and verify independently.

#### Task requirements

- Tasks are derived from the plan, not invented independently
- Each task has a clear definition of done
- Tasks are ordered to respect dependencies
- A task can be completed in a single working session

<!-- §readiness-check -->

### Readiness Check

Before implementation begins, verify the feature is ready to build. This is a quick pass/fail gate, not a ceremony.

- [ ] Spec status is `planned`
- [ ] Acceptance criteria are concrete and testable — no empty placeholders
- [ ] All open questions are resolved
- [ ] Data model exists if the feature introduces or modifies domain entities or data structures
- [ ] Plan does not conflict with `system.md` or other feature specs
- [ ] Tasks are ordered and each has a clear definition of done

If any item fails, fix the gap before writing code.

<!-- §implement-phase -->

### Implement Phase

Write code, tests, and migrations. Implementation follows the tasks list.

#### Implementation requirements

- Code matches the contracts defined in the spec
- Tests verify the acceptance criteria
- No work happens outside the tasks list — if new work is discovered, add it as a task first
- Refactoring that preserves existing behavior and contracts does not require a spec or scenario update. If a refactor reveals a missing requirement or changes documented behavior, update the spec or add a scenario to capture the new expectation before proceeding.
- Before the spec advances to `done`, `/papur:review` runs against the implementation and the spec's frontmatter `review:` block records the result. The transition is gated: `/papur:implement` halts when `review.last-run` is unset or `review.blocking` is `true`. See §spec-lifecycle.

<!-- §constants -->

#### Constants and configuration

See `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` (`CFG-CONST-NNN` rules) for the enforceable rules covering centralized shared constants, module-local constants, and the no-bare-literals requirement for operator-tunable values. `/papur:analyze` enforces these rules.

<!-- §env-vars -->

#### Environment variables

See `framework/rules/configuration-cross.md` (`CFG-ENV-NNN` rules) for the enforceable rules covering env-var defaults backed by named constants, `.env.example` completeness, fail-fast startup validation, and unit suffixes for time-valued variables. `/papur:analyze` enforces these rules.

<!-- §bug-handling -->

## Bug Handling

Bugs are unwritten or violated requirements. Every bug is evidence that one of the framework's three artifact tiers — rules (cross-cutting), specs (feature-wide), or scenarios (situational) — has a gap. Rather than tracking defects in a separate system, fixing a bug means making the requirement at the right tier more precise. See [§rules](#rules) for the rule tier and [§scenarios](#scenarios) for the scenario tier.

Not every captured item is a requirement gap. An inbox item may be a **chore** — a discrete piece of project maintenance (lint or formatting cleanup, dependency cleanup, repo hygiene, a standalone refactor) that adds no missing or violated requirement and belongs to no single feature. A chore does **not** spawn a rule, spec, or scenario, and it is **not** a spec task — a spec's `tasks.md` holds work derived from that feature's plan, never standalone chores. It stays tracked as a checkbox in `specs/inbox.md` (the project's non-feature work surface) and is resolved by being *done*, then removed — not migrated to a spec. The test is **durability**: rules, specs, and scenarios hold durable information that must stay accurate as the project evolves — feature description and context, acceptance criteria kept current, resolved open questions that serve as the project's architecture-decision record, and cross-cutting rules. A chore captures none of that; it is transient work whose value is spent once complete. Route requirement gaps through the decision tree below; leave chores in the inbox to be done directly.

### Bug Decision Tree

When a bug is reported, follow this decision tree in order. The first matching condition determines the route:

1. **No rule covers this cross-cutting concern** — the bug surfaces a class of behavior the framework should govern at the rules tier (perf budget, observability commitment, security control, accessibility minimum, etc.). Promote to a rule (new or amended), then fix the code.
2. **No spec exists for the behavior** — the bug is a feature-level gap. Write the spec first, then fix the code.
3. **Spec exists but is ambiguous or incomplete** — the bug is a spec deficiency. Correct or enhance the spec, then fix the implementation.
4. **Spec is clear but implementation is wrong** — add a scenario capturing the correct behavior, then fix the code.

In all four cases, the rule, spec, or scenario becomes more precise. The artifact update is the primary outcome, not a bug report.

<!-- §scenarios -->

### Scenarios

A scenario is a spec at a lower level of abstraction — same format, same discipline, narrower scope. Scenarios live in a `scenarios/` subdirectory alongside the spec they elaborate.

Each scenario file contains:

- **section** (frontmatter) — the parent spec section the scenario elaborates; the parent feature is implicit in the scenario's file path
- **Context** — the specific situation or precondition
- **Behavior** — what the system does in that situation
- **Edge Cases** — boundary conditions and exceptions (optional)

Scenarios use plain language. Given/When/Then syntax is not required.

#### Scenario lifecycle

Scenarios do not have their own status field. A scenario is either written (merged) or not. When a scenario is created, a task is appended to the parent spec's `tasks.md` referencing the scenario. The task carries the completion status — the scenario itself is a permanent requirement document.

- The parent spec's status remains `in-progress` while scenario tasks are being worked
- When the task is complete, the scenario stays as documentation of the expected behavior
- If a scenario becomes obsolete, it is deleted — not marked with a status

#### When to create a scenario

- A bug surfaces that the spec covers at a high level but does not describe in sufficient detail
- An edge case is discovered during implementation or review
- A spec section is growing too large and needs to be decomposed

#### When a scenario is not needed

- The spec itself was missing or ambiguous — fix the spec directly
- The behavior is already captured by an existing scenario — update the existing file

<!-- §scenario-promotion -->

#### Scenario promotion

In brownfield projects, scenarios serve a dual purpose: they elaborate edge cases (as in greenfield) and they decompose broad features into distinct workflows. When a scenario grows complex enough, it signals that the behavior warrants its own feature spec.

Indicators that a scenario should be promoted:

- The scenario has more than three edge cases
- The scenario's behavior section is longer than the parent spec's
- The scenario has open questions unrelated to the parent spec's domain
- Multiple scenarios in the same feature share overlapping concerns that would be better unified in their own spec

To promote: the user runs `/specify` to create the new spec (whether the behavior is new or an existing feature being decomposed — `/specify` accepts both greenfield and brownfield input), then replaces the original scenario with a dependency reference in the parent spec.

Promotion is a user decision, not automated. The framework provides the pattern; the user recognizes when decomposition is needed.

<!-- §rules -->

### Rules

A rule is an enforceable, citable requirement that applies across multiple features. Rules are the third artifact tier — alongside specs (feature-wide) and scenarios (situational), rules cover **cross-cutting** concerns the framework has opinions about regardless of which feature is being built (security, performance, concurrency, observability, accessibility, audit/compliance, data handling).

Rule files ship under `specs/rules/{rule-set}.md` and are referenced from feature specs by ID. The canonical example is `specs/rules/security-backend.md`, whose rules (e.g., `BE-AUTHN-001`) any spec touching authentication can cite. `/papur:analyze` enforces rules — it loads each rule file, runs each rule's Verification step against feature artifacts, and reports gaps.

#### Rule format (summary)

Every rule has four required fields:

- **ID** — a permanent identifier (e.g., `BE-AUTHN-001`) cited from feature specs.
- **Statement** — one sentence using RFC 2119 keywords (MUST, MUST NOT, SHOULD, SHOULD NOT). MUST/MUST NOT rules are blocking; SHOULD/SHOULD NOT are advisory.
- **Rationale** — the threat or risk the rule mitigates.
- **Verification** — instruction to the validate agent on how to check compliance against feature artifacts.

The full schema, ID-stability invariants, the ID grammar (including the `[A-Z][A-Z0-9]*` category-abbreviation format), and Verification phrasing rules are canonically declared in `specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md` — and, for configuration rules, in `specs/017-derive-dont-ask/data-model.md`. The specific category abbreviations a given rule file uses are declared in that file's own header (e.g., `api-backend.md` declares `SCHEMA`/`APIVER`/…). New rule files follow the same schema.

#### When to write a rule

A new (or amended) rule is justified when **all four** of these hold:

1. **Cross-cutting** — the concern applies to multiple existing or anticipated features, not a single feature's domain.
2. **Citable** — the concern's verification can be expressed as a step a reviewer or `/papur:analyze` can check (a code-pattern check, a documentation-commitment check, or both).
3. **Governance-recognized category** — the concern belongs to a class the framework treats as foundational (security, performance, concurrency, observability, accessibility, audit/compliance, data handling, etc.) rather than feature-specific behavior.
4. **Generalizable wording** — the rule statement would make sense in any spec that touches the area, not only the spec that motivated it.

Indicators are evaluative, not mechanical. The same judgment discipline applies to rule promotion as to scenario promotion ([§scenario-promotion](#scenario-promotion)) — the framework provides the pattern; the user recognizes when promotion is warranted.

#### When a rule is not needed

- The concern is **situational** (specific condition, concrete behavior) → write a scenario under the affected spec.
- The concern is **feature-wide** (one feature, broad property) → add an acceptance criterion or section to that spec.
- An existing rule already covers the concern → cite the existing rule from the spec rather than creating a new one.

#### Filename suffix

Rule filenames signal the surface a rule applies to via a closed-suffix convention. Every `framework/rules/*.md` file MUST end in exactly one of:

- `-backend.md` — loaded for backend stacks
- `-frontend.md` — loaded for frontend stacks
- `-cross.md` — loaded for all stacks (cross-cutting)

The suffix is the surface signal `/papur:review` and `/papur:analyze` use to derive rule-file selection without a hardcoded allowlist. `/papur:review` filters discovered files by the project's detected stack; `/papur:analyze` loads every discovered file regardless of stack (citation verification spans surfaces).

Enforcement is two-layered. In `govern`'s own repository, `scripts/lint-rule-filenames.sh` fails CI on any file that violates the closed-suffix policy. In adopter repositories — where the lint does not run — a rule file with an unrecognized suffix loads for every stack and emits a one-line stdout warning (`rule file <name> has unrecognized suffix — loading for all stacks; rename to -backend.md, -frontend.md, or -cross.md`). The default is "load + warn," never "silent skip."

#### Project-level opt-out

A project may exclude a stack-selected rule file from `/papur:review` by listing it in `.govern.toml` `[[review.disabled-rule-files]]` with a mandatory `reason` — the reason is the audit trail for the override, surfaced on stdout at the start of every run. The opt-out is project-wide and applies to whole files; per-`(rule, file)` exceptions remain the job of `/papur:review --waive`. Schema and behavior are documented in [`framework/commands/review.md`](commands/review.md).

#### Lifecycle

- Rule IDs are permanent. Once assigned, an ID is never renumbered, even if the rule moves within the file or is edited.
- Rules are deprecated with a `**DEPRECATED in {version}:**` label and a removal target version, then removed only after the deprecation window has passed.
- New rule files are introduced via their own feature spec (the same way 008 introduced `security-backend.md` and `security-frontend.md`). **Recorded exception (backfill):** `api-backend.md`, `accessibility-frontend.md`, and `performance-frontend.md` were introduced in commit `9ccbd0b` bundled into specs 024/025 rather than through their own introducing specs. They are in active use — discovered by the suffix directory-walk and cited by ID like every other rule file — and their ID grammar is reconciled with this section, so they are retained as-is; no retroactive introducing specs are required.

See `specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md` for the full ID-stability invariants and deprecation rules.

#### Three tiers, selected by scope

| Tier | Scope | Artifact |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Rule** | Cross-cutting (applies across many features) | A rule file under `specs/rules/{rule-set}.md`, cited by ID from the specs that depend on it |
| **Spec / acceptance criterion** | Feature-wide (one feature, broad property) | A section or AC in the feature's `spec.md` |
| **Scenario** | Situational (a specific condition with concrete behavior) | A file in the feature's `scenarios/` directory |

Bugs route to the tier that matches the *scope* of the missing or violated requirement (see [Bug Decision Tree](#bug-decision-tree) above). A perf bug that affects every API endpoint promotes to a rule; a perf bug specific to one feature becomes an acceptance criterion; a perf bug that only manifests under a specific concurrency condition becomes a scenario.

<!-- §brownfield-inbox -->

### Brownfield Inbox

A `specs/inbox.md` file is the project's capture queue for issues not yet assigned to a feature spec. It serves two roles:

- **Brownfield migration** — for projects adopting `govern` incrementally, known issues are parked here until a spec exists to absorb them.
- **Incidental capture** — issues an agent discovers as a side effect of other work are recorded here automatically (see [Automatic issue capture](#automatic-issue-capture) below).

Items are recorded with `/log` (manual) or captured automatically during work, and groomed into their proper home with `/groom`. An item's "proper home" is usually a feature spec, scenario, or rule; an item that is a **chore** (project maintenance belonging to no feature — lint or dependency cleanup, repo hygiene, see [§bug-handling](#bug-handling)) has no spec home and is resolved by being done directly, then removed — `/groom` recognizes it and leaves it in place rather than forcing it into a spec.

Inbox rules:

- Do not frontfill bugs that are not being actively worked on
- Write specs for areas being actively touched — let adoption spread naturally
- As specs are written, `/groom` migrates items from the inbox into their proper home
- The brownfield-migration backlog drains toward empty as adoption completes; the incidental-capture role is ongoing, so the file persists as long as new work keeps surfacing new issues

#### Automatic issue capture

While working a task, an agent surfaces issues that fall outside the current task's scope — a security weakness, a resource or memory leak, a violated convention, a latent bug in adjacent code. These MUST be captured, not dropped:

- **Capture automatically, without prompting.** When an agent identifies such an issue during any task work, it appends the issue to `specs/inbox.md` itself — the same mechanical append `/log` performs — without pausing to ask the user. Capture is not a pipeline gate; it never interrupts the task in flight.
- **Record, do not derail.** The agent does not stop the current task to fix an out-of-scope issue. It records the finding and continues. An issue *inside* the current task's scope is fixed as part of the task, not logged.
- **Severity raises salience, not the routing.** Security issues and memory or resource leaks are the cases most costly to lose, so they are captured first and flagged; convention violations and lesser findings are captured the same way. Everything routes through `/groom` later — capture itself is uninterpreted.
- **Surface at completion.** Issues captured during a unit of work are presented back to the user when that work completes — as part of the `/papur:implement` completion summary and the `/papur:review` report. The surfacing step is the backstop that keeps capture from being silent: per the **Design Principles** rule, the framework does not rely on the agent *remembering* a mid-task finding, it makes every capture visible at the next gate.

This keeps the agent's attention on the task while guaranteeing that incidental discoveries reach the inbox and, through `/groom`, the right artifact tier ([Bug Decision Tree](#bug-decision-tree)).

<!-- §brownfield-process -->

### Brownfield Process

Brownfield projects adopt `govern` incrementally. The `/specify` command initializes a skeleton spec from freeform user input — sparse acceptance criteria are expected and valid for brownfield use; no pressure to be comprehensive. Start broad; decompose through scenarios over time.

#### Capture → incremental growth → promotion

1. **Capture** — the user runs `/specify` with whatever description they have. Sparse acceptance criteria are expected and valid — the spec gains precision through subsequent bug fixes, scenarios, and clarifications.
2. **Incremental growth** — every subsequent touch on the feature adds precision:
   - A **bug fix** reveals missing behavior → adds an acceptance criterion or scenario
   - An **enhancement** adds new behavior → follows the normal pipeline (spec change before implementation)
   - A **clarification** resolves an open question → narrows ambiguity
3. **Promotion** — when a scenario outgrows its parent spec, the user promotes it to its own feature spec (see [Scenario promotion](#scenario-promotion))

Over time the spec converges on a complete description of the feature — not from a documentation effort, but as a side effect of doing work.

#### Inbox integration

When a `/groom` pass encounters an item that does not map to any existing spec, `/groom` directs the user to run `/specify` to initialize a spec first, then return to process the item. The commands stay decoupled — `/log` records, `/groom` routes, `/specify` creates specs.

<!-- §text-first-artifacts -->

## Text-First Artifacts

`govern` treats every artifact — constitution, specs, plans, tasks, scenarios, rules — as plain markdown the agent can edit with `Edit`. This is load-bearing: the agent's write path stays simple, PRs review glanceably, and merge conflicts stay rare and human-resolvable. The markdown framework is usable standalone with no tooling beyond the AI agent; an optional runtime (see [§runtime-boundary](#runtime-boundary)) provides deterministic execution of mechanical checks and fixes for adopters who opt in.

### Principles

- All `govern` artifacts are markdown by default. The agent reads and writes them with the same `Edit` flow used for code.
- Structured metadata lives in YAML frontmatter at the top of each markdown file; the document body remains markdown prose.
- Cross-artifact references use standard relative markdown links (`[label](../path.md)`), not wiki-links — this keeps PRs reviewable on GitHub and viewers like Quartz/Obsidian still resolve them.
- Source-of-truth artifacts are markdown. Structured derived views are regenerated from canonical sources and never become the canonical record.
- Structured derived views (SQLite caches, JSON indexes, generated graph data, binary artifacts) MUST be gitignored and regenerated on demand by their consumers.
- Exceptions to text-first source-of-truth require an explicit constitutional amendment with stated rationale.

### Frontmatter Schema

The frontmatter schema applies to **spec files** (`spec.md`) and **scenario files** (`scenarios/{slug}.md`). Other `govern` artifacts (`system.md`, `errors.md`, `events.md`, `inbox.md`, plan files, tasks files, rule files, README files) MAY include frontmatter when a specific consumer benefits, but are not required to.

#### Spec files

| Field | Required | Type | Allowed values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `status` | yes | string | `draft`, `clarified`, `planned`, `in-progress`, `done` | Spec lifecycle state |
| `dependencies` | yes | list of strings | spec slugs (e.g., `002-events`); empty list permitted | **Generated** by `scripts/gen-spec-deps.sh` from inline markdown links to sibling specs in the body. Not hand-authored. Author opt-out: links under a `## See also` heading are treated as navigational and do not produce edges (`## References` remains a dep-producing section). |
| `references` | no | list of `{service, spec}` entries | registered service alias + target `NNN-slug`; empty or absent permitted | **Generated** by `scripts/gen-cross-service-refs.sh` from inline body links to a registered service's canonical repo URL. Not hand-authored, and **strictly distinct from `dependencies`** — informative cross-service navigation that never enters the blocking dependency graph (spec 030). |

#### Scenario files

| Field | Required | Type | Allowed values | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `section` | yes | string | parent spec section name (e.g., `"Authentication flow"`) | The section of the parent spec the scenario elaborates. The parent feature is implicit in the file path. |

#### Open-schema rule

Additional fields beyond those listed above are permitted and ignored by uninterested consumers. Examples adopters or future `govern` work might add: `owner`, `target_release`, `created_at`, `description`, `aliases`. Consumers MUST NOT error on the presence of unknown fields. `/gov:analyze` reports unknown fields as informational findings (not errors). Stale fields in done specs (e.g., `title`, `tags`, `spec-ref`, `track`) remain valid under this rule and produce no findings.

### Validation Severity

`/gov:analyze` checks frontmatter against this schema with the following severity:

- **Hard fail** — frontmatter block missing on a spec or scenario file; frontmatter YAML malformed; `status` missing or not in the allowed set; `dependencies` missing or not a list; both `section` and the legacy `spec-ref` missing on a scenario.
- **Advisory** — cross-reference checks; body inline links to sibling specs that are not yet in the generator-managed `dependencies` (informational — the next commit's `gen-spec-deps.sh` run will resolve).
- **Informational** — unknown fields present.

Hard fails block the validation pass. Advisory and informational findings are reported but do not block.

For non-frontmatter checks (spec integrity, artifact completeness, plan/task consistency, dependencies, security rules), `/gov:analyze` adds a fourth tier — **Blocking** — between Hard fail and Advisory. Blocking findings are structural or content issues that must be fixed before the next pipeline gate fires (e.g., missing `plan.md` on a `planned` spec, an unknown rule ID referenced in a spec). Hard fail and Blocking both prevent pipeline advancement; the distinction is that Hard fail says "the spec file itself is malformed," while Blocking says "the artifact set is incomplete or inconsistent." See `framework/commands/analyze.md` for the full per-check severity assignment.

<!-- §runtime-boundary -->

### Runtime Boundary

`govern` MAY ship an optional runtime binary alongside the markdown framework. The runtime exists to execute the deterministic portions of pipeline commands without an LLM. This subsection defines what the runtime can and cannot do; deviations require their own constitutional amendment.

#### Five principles

1. **Markdown is source of truth** — the runtime MUST NOT own state the markdown cannot reconstruct. Runtime-owned data (caches, indexes, parsed graphs) is derived and gitignored, per the existing rule on structured derived views.
2. **Determinism only** — the runtime MUST NOT call an LLM. Work requiring semantic judgment (content quality, `/clarify` resolution, `/specify` sketching, per-rule Verification reads, `/groom` routing) stays in slash commands.
3. **Opt-in for adopters** — the runtime MUST NOT be a prerequisite for any pipeline gate. A markdown-only adopter — agent + the host's file tools (`Read`, `Edit`, `Write`), no binary on `PATH` — must complete every cycle (greenfield, brownfield, reopen) and reach `done` on every spec. The markdown-only path operates through those host tools; shell pipelines that parse frontmatter or markdown structure (`awk`, `sed`, `grep` pipelines, `for` loops over files) are **not** a sanctioned substitute for either the runtime primitives or the host's file tools.
4. **Schema follows the constitution** — the runtime MUST read frontmatter and artifact structure according to the schemas declared in this document. Schema changes ship through the constitution; the runtime MUST update to match. The constitution MUST NOT import runtime types.
5. **MCP is the seam** — the runtime MUST expose its capabilities as MCP tools so slash commands can call them when they want determinism. This keeps the runtime accessible to any agent host and prevents `govern`-specific coupling.

#### Eligibility criteria

A capability is runtime-eligible only when **all three** hold:

1. **Deterministic** — no semantic judgment required; the same inputs always produce the same outputs.
2. **Currently mechanical** — already either (a) executed by an LLM following procedural instructions in a slash command body, or (b) implemented as a bash script invoked by `govern` workflows.
3. **Degradation, not failure, when removed** — without the runtime, the work still completes correctly via the markdown-only path; only speed, cost, or reliability degrades.

A capability that fails any criterion stays out of the runtime. Anything that requires reading prose for intent is permanently LLM-owned regardless of how mechanical its surface looks.

#### Opt-in invariant

The repository's CI MUST include a job that exercises a representative pipeline cycle end-to-end with the runtime binary absent from `PATH`. A change that causes this job to fail — i.e., a slash command that silently requires the runtime — is a constitution violation, not a feature.

#### Versioning

The runtime ships in lockstep with the framework. A `govern` release includes the binary built against the schemas in that release; an adopter's `govern` version pins their compatible runtime version, eliminating schema/runtime drift as a failure mode.

#### What the runtime is not

To prevent scope creep, the runtime MUST NOT be a spec authoring tool, MUST NOT be a workflow orchestrator, MUST NOT be a long-running service, and MUST NOT be a storage layer. Lifting any of these exclusions requires a constitutional amendment.

Specific capabilities are introduced through their own feature specs, beginning with spec 022 (deterministic runtime).

<!-- §drift-prevention -->

## Drift Prevention

These principles keep facts consistent as the framework evolves. They apply both to `govern` itself and to projects that adopt it. Drift is a class of bug; preventing it is part of the framework's design, not an afterthought.

### Canonical sources

For every kind of fact described in multiple places, one location is authoritative. Other documents that describe the fact MUST reference the canonical source rather than restate it.

| Fact | Canonical source |
| --- | --- |
| Spec lifecycle states and back-edges | `framework/constitution.md` §spec-lifecycle |
| Pipeline command behavior | each command's source under `framework/commands/*.md` (or `framework/bootstrap/configure/{key}.md`) |
| Frontmatter schema for specs and scenarios | `framework/constitution.md` §text-first-artifacts |
| Validation severity tiers | `framework/constitution.md` §text-first-artifacts (Validation Severity subsection) |
| Workflow registry | `framework/workflows/registry.json` |
| Per-agent permission set | `framework/bootstrap/configure/{key}.md` |
| Constitution section anchors | `<!-- §<anchor> -->` markers in `framework/constitution.md` |
| Command frontmatter (description, argument-hint) | each command's own frontmatter block |
| Rules artifact tier definition | `framework/constitution.md` §rules |
| Runtime contract / boundary | `framework/constitution.md` §runtime-boundary |
| Security rule file format and ID conventions (`BE-`/`FE-`) | `specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md` |
| Configuration rule file format and ID conventions (`CFG-`) | `specs/017-derive-dont-ask/data-model.md` |
| Service registry schema (`.govern.toml` `[services]`) | `specs/030-cross-service-references/data-model.md` |
| Where contributor knowledge is recorded (git vs. per-user agent memory) | `framework/constitution.md` §drift-prevention (Shared knowledge stays in git) |

When adding a new kind of fact that may be referenced from multiple documents, name its canonical source explicitly here.

### Cross-document references

When document B describes content authored in document A, B includes a back-link to A — relative markdown link, anchor reference (`§anchor`), or section name. Two consequences follow:

- Changing A includes auditing every back-link to A. The audit is structured wherever it can be machine-checked (anchor resolution, help-table descriptions, registry-frontmatter equivalence), and a manual sweep otherwise.
- Adding a fact that conceptually belongs in A but landing it in B is drift. Either move the fact to A and back-link, or extend A's scope explicitly.

### Template-rule alignment

Every blocking check in `/papur:analyze` has a corresponding scaffolding element in the template that produces a passing artifact by default. The contract runs in both directions:

- Adding a new blocking check requires a template update so a freshly-copied artifact passes the check without manual editing.
- Adding template structure requires a corresponding rule (validate check, constitution rule, or both). Sections that don't trace back to a rule are dead weight.

Templates and validate evolve together. A diff that touches one without the other is incomplete.

### Manifest discipline

When multiple commands distribute or reference the same set of files (e.g., `/govern` and `/papur:init` both scaffold a project; `/papur:configure` and the bootstrap install both apply permission sets), the file list lives in one place:

- Either as a shared section the commands include by reference, or
- As a registry both commands read.

Two commands that copy-paste the same manifest into their own bodies are guaranteed to drift over time. Consolidate or accept that drift is the rule, not the exception.

### Shared knowledge stays in git

Knowledge that would help any other contributor belongs in a git-tracked artifact, never in an AI agent's per-user memory. Per-user memory stores (Claude Code's auto-memory, Cursor's memories, and equivalents) live outside the repository — invisible to every other contributor and absent from a fresh clone — so a fact parked there is guaranteed to drift from the shared source the moment anyone else works the area. It is the most severe form of the drift this section exists to prevent: not an inconsistency between two committed documents, but knowledge that was never committed at all.

- A **project learning** — a convention, a gotcha, a workflow rule, a boundary — goes in `AGENTS.md` (or the matching rule file under `specs/rules/`), where every contributor and every agent reads it.
- A **durable requirement** goes in its canonical artifact: a spec, a scenario, a rule, or this constitution (see [Canonical sources](#canonical-sources)).
- **Per-user agent memory** is correct only for facts that carry no value to other contributors — who the individual user is (role, persistent personal preferences) and external reference pointers (issue-tracker, chat, or dashboard bookmarks).

The test before saving to per-user memory: *would this help a teammate?* If yes, commit it. A host's own rules file (`CLAUDE.md`, `AGENTS.md`) supplies the agent-specific routing that applies this principle.

<!-- §pipeline-boundaries -->

## Pipeline Boundaries

- Never implement without a spec
- Never plan without resolving open questions
- Never skip phases — each phase produces artifacts the next phase consumes
- Never transition a spec to the next status without explicit user approval — present the work done and wait for the user to confirm before updating the status field
- Specs and plans are living documents — update them when decisions change, but don't backtrack silently

<!-- §concurrent-features -->

### Concurrent Features

The session state file (`.govern.session.toml` at the repo root) holds a single target by design. The pipeline is serial within a feature, and concurrent work on independent features uses two independent sessions in two terminals — not multi-target session state. Isolation is provided by the platform layer: `git worktree` keeps the working trees separate, and AI-agent platforms typically expose isolation primitives (Claude Code's `isolation: "worktree"` agent parameter, Cursor's worktree integration, etc.). Reach for those rather than asking `govern` to track multiple targets at once.

<!-- §cross-spec-impact -->

### Cross-Spec Impact

Specs are self-contained. When work on one spec identifies changes that affect another spec, those changes are recorded in the affected spec — not left as a note in the originating spec. The affected spec is the source of truth for its own behavior.

This applies when:

- A feature renames or supersedes an artifact from a prior spec
- Work on spec A reveals that spec B needs a new acceptance criterion or scenario
- A scenario in spec A exposes an edge case that belongs to spec B
- An implementation decision in spec A's plan creates a constraint for spec B

In each case:

- The change is recorded in the affected spec as a new acceptance criterion, scenario, or signpost note
- The signpost references the originating spec so the reader understands why the change was made
- If the affected spec is `done`, adding the change reopens it to `in-progress` per the normal lifecycle

The originating spec's acceptance criteria include delivering the cross-spec update. This ensures the change is tracked as part of the work that discovered it.

<!-- §numbering -->

## Numbering Convention

Feature directories use three-digit zero-padded numbers: `000-skeleton`, `001-observability`, `002-events`. Numbers establish creation order and suggest a natural implementation sequence, but dependencies between features determine the actual build order.

<!-- §markdown-standards -->

## Markdown Standards

All `.md` files must pass `npx markdownlint-cli2` using the project config in `.markdownlint-cli2.jsonc`.

Key rules:

- Every fenced code block must specify a language — **MD040**
- Files must start with a top-level heading — **MD041**
- No trailing spaces or missing blank lines around headings, lists, and fenced code blocks
- ATX-style headings only (`#`, `##`, etc.)
- Heading levels increment by one — **MD001**
- No duplicate headings at the same level within the same parent — **MD024** (siblings\_only)
- Link fragments must reference valid heading anchors — **MD051**
- Ordered lists use sequential numbering — **MD029**
- Tables use compact style: `| text |` — **MD060**
- Line length is not enforced (MD013 disabled)
- Inline HTML is allowed (MD033 disabled)
