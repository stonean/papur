# {NNN} — {Feature Name}

{Brief description of what this feature does and why it exists.}

## {Section}

<!-- Organize the spec into sections that describe behavior, contracts, and constraints.
     Use headings that make sense for this feature — there is no fixed set of required sections
     beyond Acceptance Criteria and Open Questions.

     Metadata (status, dependencies) lives in the YAML frontmatter block above —
     not in the body. Run /papur:clarify, /papur:plan, and /papur:implement
     to advance status; the commands update the frontmatter for you. The
     `dependencies` list is generated from inline markdown links to sibling specs
     in the body — do not edit it by hand.

     Branch-scoped specs: a spec created with a branch-style number
     (`{branch-id}.{n}-slug`, e.g. `1234.1-slug`) carries one extra
     frontmatter key, `folds-into:`, naming the upstream spec it folds back
     into. It is written by /papur:specify at creation and is the one
     frontmatter field you may edit by hand — correcting a target that names
     the wrong spec, or removing it (and renaming the directory) when the team
     decides the spec should stand on its own. The named spec normally lives
     on the upstream branch and is absent from your working tree; that is
     expected, not an error. While the key is present the spec carries
     outstanding work, so it is reported by /papur:status and cannot reach
     `done` — after the merge, target it and fold it.

     Cross-service references: to reference a spec in another service (its own
     repo with its own ductus install), write a normal inline markdown link to
     that spec's absolute canonical URL in the body — shaped like (backticks
     here only to keep this example from being harvested as a real reference):
     `[api 014-auth-tokens](https://github.com/acme/api/blob/main/specs/014-auth-tokens/spec.md)`.
     The `references` frontmatter (distinct from `dependencies`, never blocking)
     is generated from it — do not edit it by hand. Register the service with
     /papur:link so the reference resolves to the linked spec's status.
     Sibling (../NNN-slug/) links stay dependencies; absolute service URLs become
     references. See the README's "Cross-service references" section.

     Scenarios: when a spec section needs lower-level elaboration (edge cases, bug fixes,
     detailed behavior), run /papur:amend to record a scenario file under
     specs/{NNN-feature-name}/scenarios/.

     Motivation, if you write one: put it in the past tense. A Motivation
     describes the world BEFORE the feature, so every present-tense claim in it
     ("the CLI has no way to X", "nothing validates Y") becomes false the moment
     the spec ships — and unlike a broken link, nothing marks it stale. Write
     "the CLI had no way to X" and it stays true forever. This is an authoring
     convention rather than a check: detecting it needs tense analysis, which no
     deterministic check carries.

## Acceptance Criteria

At least one concrete, testable criterion is required before `/papur:clarify` will advance the spec.

<!-- Concrete, testable conditions that define "done". Each criterion should be verifiable
     through a test or observable behavior. Replace this comment block with real `- [ ]`
     checkbox items. Example:

- [ ] Health endpoint returns 200 when all dependencies are reachable
- [ ] Health endpoint returns 503 with a JSON body listing failures when any check fails
- [ ] Auth middleware rejects requests without a valid session or token with 401

## Applicable Rules

<!-- Optional. Cite rule IDs (from rule files like specs/rules/security-backend.md) that
     constrain the surface this spec touches. Citing rules here makes the cross-
     cutting requirements this spec depends on visible to reviewers and to
     /papur:analyze, which checks every cited ID against the loaded rule
     files. See §rules in the constitution for when a concern belongs in a rule
     vs an acceptance criterion vs a scenario.

     Replace this comment block with a list of rule references when applicable:

- `BE-AUTHN-001` — memory-hard password hashing
- `FE-XSS-002` — output encoding strategy
- `BE-INPUT-001` — server-side input validation

     Delete this section entirely if no rules apply to the area this spec covers.
-->

## Open Questions

<!-- Uncertainties, unresolved decisions, and areas needing investigation.
     All open questions must be resolved before moving to the plan phase.

     To surface questions: assume this feature shipped and failed — what went wrong? Example:

- Should rate limits be configurable per tenant or fixed globally?
- What is the retention policy for audit log entries?
- What happens when the sessions table grows unbounded?

     When a question is resolved, move it to a "Resolved Questions" section with its answer.
