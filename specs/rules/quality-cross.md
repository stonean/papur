# Code Quality Rules

Enforceable code-quality rules that are not specific to a surface. These rules apply to all projects adopting `govern` regardless of stack — code-quality discipline is the same problem on backend workers, domain methods, middleware, and frontend stores alike.

Rules use RFC 2119 language: **MUST** / **MUST NOT** are enforced as errors; **SHOULD** / **SHOULD NOT** are flagged as warnings.

Rule IDs follow the format `QUAL-{CATEGORY}-{NNN}` and are permanent — once assigned, an ID is never renumbered, even if the rule is moved within the file or deprecated. Categories: `STUB` (silent stubs). See `specs/036-quality-cross-rules/data-model.md` for the `QUAL` surface registration and `specs/008-security-rules/data-model.md` for the full rule schema.

These rules verify **code patterns** rather than design-time commitments; `/papur:review`'s quality pass enforces them against source in scope. Cross-cutting (`-cross.md`) rule files always apply — a project that customizes this file can pin it in `.govern.toml` `[pinned]` so `govern` updates skip it.

## QUAL-STUB — Silent stubs

### QUAL-STUB-001

> A partial or unimplemented code path whose surrounding contract implies it performs work MUST fail loudly — via a panic, an explicit error return, or a failing/skipped test fixture — rather than silently passing through. Returning a zero value, returning `next` unchanged from middleware, returning early from a handler without an error, or returning `nil, nil` from such a method is a silent pass-through and does not satisfy this rule.

**Rationale:** Silent stubs ship indistinguishably from working implementations — a no-op rate-limiter, an always-allow permission check, a publisher that drops events on the floor — and the gap surfaces only when the missing behavior is needed, which is precisely when the system is under stress. In the anvil adopter project, a passthrough stub left in `RateLimit` enabled-mode would have silently disabled rate limiting in production had the follow-on task been skipped; failing loudly turns that latent production incident into an immediate, visible failure at the point the stub is exercised (or built/tested).

**Verification:** `/papur:review`'s quality pass flags a code path in scope when **all three** hold: (1) it is **reachable** under the current spec; (2) its **surrounding contract implies work** — it is named for a behavior, documented to do something, or called by code that depends on its effect; and (3) it returns a success / zero / pass-through value with **no loud signal**. The following are compliant and are **not** flagged: an explicit incompleteness marker (`panic`/`todo!`/`unimplemented!`, a raised not-implemented error, or a failing/skipped test fixture) — that *is* failing loudly; intentional pass-through middleware documented as deliberate; a default or interface implementation meant to be empty; and a not-yet-reachable branch behind a feature flag or guard. The build-time **schema** fail-loud case is already governed by `api-backend.md` `BE-SCHEMA-002` — this rule covers the broader runtime/contract case across all surfaces rather than restating it.
