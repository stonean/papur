# Target

Set the working feature (and optionally scenario) for this session.

## Purpose

Establishes which feature spec all subsequent `/papur:*` commands operate on. Optionally targets a specific scenario within the feature for scenario-aware commands. Must be run before any pipeline command. Remains active for the session unless changed by running `/papur:target` again.

## Scope Boundaries

- Read `.ductus/constitution.md` once per session and the targeted feature's `spec.md` frontmatter and open-question count. `read-spec` also returns the feature's scenario open questions (a separate field; it reads `scenarios/*.md` to derive them), which step 9 reports. Read a targeted scenario file directly only when one is specified.
- Do NOT read plan files, tasks, source code, test files, or unrelated specs' bodies.
- Do NOT modify any spec, plan, scenario, or source file. The only file written is the session file (`.ductus/session.toml`). Status transitions belong to the pipeline commands (`/papur:clarify`, `/papur:plan`, `/papur:implement`) and to `/papur:amend` (the documented back-edges: `clarified|planned|in-progress → draft` on a new question, and `done → in-progress` on a new scenario).
- Reference: §spec-lifecycle, §scenarios, §concurrent-features, §text-first-artifacts.

## Instructions

> **For agent runtimes**: the Invoke steps below call the MCP tools of the ductus runtime; the host-integration contract — bare↔prefixed tool names, lazy ToolSearch schema fetch, the no-shell-utilities rule, and the two-paths guarantee — lives once in the constitution, §runtime-host-integration. Before the server is registered — the window between acquisition and the restart that loads it — walk the same prose using the host file-reading tools (Read, Edit, Write).

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
1. When the invocation has no argument (whitespace or empty), read the session file — the newest of `.ductus/session.toml`, `.govern/session.toml`, or the legacy root `.govern.session.toml` that exists (the parity strict-files frontmatter above names the legacy path, matching the legacy-layout parity fixtures) — to display the current target. If the file is empty or absent, report no target set; otherwise display the feature name and status, the scenario detail when one is targeted (scenario name, the section field or legacy spec-ref field, and the context summary), and the artifacts list. Then stop — the steps below only apply when a feature argument is supplied. Treat `0`, `00`, or any other non-whitespace string as a valid feature identifier.

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
2. When the invocation argument is exactly `--clear`, clear the session target through the write-session primitive's clear mode: it removes the target block (feature / path / scenario / scenario-path / set-at) while preserving any cli-config-dir (the per-contributor agent identity written by `/ductus`) so `ductus exec` keeps resolving command files. On the markdown-only path, reach the same reset state by hand: if the session file records a cli-config-dir, rewrite it to contain only that key via the tempfile + rename pattern; otherwise delete the file. Either way no `feature` remains, so the dashboard's documented "session file → session-target: null" reset state holds. Emit `Session cleared. Run /papur:target to set a new target.` and stop — the steps below only apply when a feature argument is supplied. `--clear` combined with a feature argument or a scenario suffix halts with `/papur:target: --clear cannot be combined with a feature argument` (no session mutation). When the session file is already absent, this is a no-op that still emits the confirmation line.

3. Parse the argument: when the value contains a slash, split into a feature-part and a scenario-slug; otherwise treat the value as a feature-part with no scenario. Invoke `resolve-feature` with the feature-part as the identifier — it scans the configured specs root and matches by exact directory name, feature number (zero-padded or not), or unique case-insensitive partial slug, returning the directory name, path, and status. Ambiguity and no-match are domain outcomes the host mediates: on `ambiguous`, list the returned candidates and ask the user to choose; on `not-found`, report the feature does not exist and list available features (the `not-found` result carries no candidate list — enumerate them from the dashboard payload's `specs[].slug`, or a specs-directory listing on the markdown-only path).

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
4. Load the constitution file once per session to make its sections available for subsequent commands. (Host responsibility — no primitive reads the constitution.)

5. Invoke `run-generator` against the dependency generator as a safety net (dry-run only). When it reports drift, the `dependencies:` frontmatter is stale from uncommitted body edits — surface that and recommend committing (the pre-commit hook syncs it) or running `.ductus/scripts/gen-spec-deps.sh` manually. Do **not** run the generator for real from `/papur:target`: this command writes only the session file (see Scope Boundaries), while the generator rewrites `dependencies:` across every spec. On the markdown-only path, run `.ductus/scripts/gen-spec-deps.sh --dry-run` by hand and surface a diff the same way.

6. Invoke `read-spec` against the resolved feature to load frontmatter, sections, and the open-question count from the body. The frontmatter status is normally one of draft, clarified, planned, in-progress, or done — `read-spec` returns it verbatim, and `/papur:analyze` (through its frontmatter-validation step) owns flagging an out-of-set value.

7. When a scenario was provided, invoke `resolve-feature` again with the scenario slug as the scenario argument: the result's scenario block reports the scenario file's path, whether it exists, and its section frontmatter field (falling back to the legacy spec-ref field for pre-017 scenarios). Capture the context summary from the scenario body with host file tools — the summary is not a primitive result. If the scenario does not exist, list available scenarios and ask the user to choose (host-mediated domain outcome).

8. Invoke `write-session` with the feature slug as the feature argument, the repo-relative spec directory — under the configured `[paths] specs-root` (default `specs`; spec 040) — as the path argument, and the scenario slug plus its file path as the scenario and scenario-path arguments when one is targeted (omit both to clear any previously set scenario). This is a *target write*: the primitive sets feature/path/(scenario) and stamps a fresh set-at while **preserving** any cli-config-dir already in the file (the per-contributor agent identity written by `/ductus`), at `.ductus/session.toml` (repo root; gitignored; same path for every adopter regardless of AI CLI or project name), and applies tempfile + rename atomic-write semantics. On the markdown-only path (no runtime on `PATH`), the host first reads any existing `.ductus/session.toml` to capture its cli-config-dir, then writes the TOML directly — top-level keys feature, path, optional scenario, optional scenario-path, set-at (ISO 8601 UTC), then the preserved cli-config-dir (when present) — through the same tempfile + rename pattern.

9. Display the resolved target: feature name and current status, scenario detail when present, the artifacts list (which of spec.md, plan.md, tasks.md, and data-model.md exist), the dependency status from step 5, the open-question count, the outstanding scenario questions per **Scenario open questions** below, and the next pipeline step per the Status → next action table below.

## Scenario open questions

`read-spec` (step 6) returns scenario open questions as a field separate from the spec body's open-question count, each entry tagged with its source scenario. Report them whenever the count is non-zero, **including when no scenario is targeted** — a contributor who targets the feature is exactly the one who cannot otherwise see them.

- Display the total and name every scenario carrying questions, in the order `read-spec` returns them (the shared scenario-file listing's case-insensitive filename order). List them **all**, with no cap: a truncated list reads as "these are the ones that need attention" while hiding others.
- Recommend no specific scenario. Nothing mechanical can rank them — question count is not importance, and one wire-contract decision outweighs three cosmetic ones. The recommended *action* is singular (scenario-targeted clarification); which scenario to target is the contributor's choice. This mirrors the unmatched-slug path in step 7, which lists the available scenarios and asks the user to choose.
- The recommended next step for a feature with outstanding scenario questions is `/papur:clarify` (scenario-targeted) rather than `/papur:implement` — see the Status → next action table's override below.
- A question deferred rather than undecided ("not now; revisit when X lands") is resolved *with a condition* and belongs in the scenario's `## Resolved Questions` with its trigger recorded; only `## Open Questions` entries count. See [046 — Scenario open-question visibility](../../specs/046-scenario-open-question-visibility/spec.md).

The scenario-targeted path (step 7) is unchanged: when a scenario is targeted, its own detail and open-question count are displayed as before.

## Status → next action

| Status | Open Questions | Next pipeline step |
| --- | --- | --- |
| draft | any | /papur:clarify |
| clarified | 0 | /papur:plan |
| planned | 0 | /papur:implement |
| in-progress | 0 | /papur:implement |
| done | any | confirm complete; run /papur:amend to record a scenario and reopen |

When the status is clarified, planned, or in-progress AND the open-question count is at least one, the next step is `/papur:clarify` (recovery). This state usually arises from a manual frontmatter edit; the normal back-edge via `/papur:amend` keeps status and open-question presence in sync.

When the feature has one or more **scenario** open questions, the next step is `/papur:clarify` (scenario-targeted) — at any status, including `done`, since a spec is not complete while its scenarios carry questions (§spec-lifecycle). Recovery takes precedence when both apply: spec-body questions at `clarified` or later are the more upstream defect, and clearing them reverts the spec to `draft` with the scenario questions still there to resolve afterward. The scenario questions are still reported in either case.
