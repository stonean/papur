# Specify

Create a new feature spec.

## Purpose

First step in the pipeline. Creates a new numbered feature directory with a spec from template and sets it as the session target. Accepts both greenfield input (rich description with concrete acceptance criteria) and brownfield input (sparse description of an existing feature) — richness scales with the input. Sparse acceptance criteria are valid for brownfield use; the spec gains precision through subsequent bug fixes, scenarios, and clarifications.

## Context

This command does not require a session target — it creates a new feature. If `.ductus/session.toml` exists, the session target will be overwritten with the new feature.

If the constitution has not been loaded in this session (e.g., `/papur:target` has not been run), read `.ductus/constitution.md` now to load `ductus` rules. If the constitution was already loaded by `/papur:target`, do not re-read it.

## Scope Boundaries

- This command creates spec artifacts only. Do NOT read or write source code, test files, or implementation files.
- Read only what is needed: existing spec directory names (for numbering and routing), each candidate's `plan.md` Affected Files and frontmatter `status`, the rule-file directory listing, and the spec template. Do NOT read other specs' bodies unless checking for naming conflicts.
- The routing gate (step 1–3) writes nothing: it derives candidates, presents them, and confirms. A denial ends the run with no directory created and no session write.
- Reference: §spec-phase, §spec-requirements, §numbering, §text-first-artifacts, §brownfield-process, §bug-handling (the routing tree, canonical in `groom.md`).

## Instructions

> **For agent runtimes**: the Invoke steps below call the MCP tools of the ductus runtime; the host-integration contract — bare↔prefixed tool names, lazy ToolSearch schema fetch, the no-shell-utilities rule, and the two-paths guarantee — lives once in the constitution, §runtime-host-integration. Before the server is registered — the window between acquisition and the restart that loads it — walk the same prose using the host file-reading tools (Read, Edit, Write).

1. Invoke `derive-routing-candidates` with the feature description from `$ARGUMENTS` (required — if empty, ask the user what feature to specify), plus `routed-by` when another command's routing tree already chose this route (`/papur:groom` recommending `/papur:specify` is the case that matters). It derives the homes this work could already have — the runtime-owning spec when the description names a primitive or a `runtime/` path, a rule surface whose category it shares, a spec whose subject it overlaps — and reports every source as examined or skipped. A `gate-required: false` result means the decision has been made already: skip steps 2 and 3 and continue at step 4.

2. <!-- llm:routeInboxItem --> Walk the **same** decision tree `/papur:groom` walks (the **Groom decision tree** reference in `groom.md` is its single canonical statement — do not restate it here), over the feature description in place of an inbox item, with step 1's candidates as evidence. Return the route and, when it targets an existing spec, the feature. `spec` — no existing home covers this — is the route that proceeds to create one.

3. Invoke `gate-confirm` with a `gate` name (e.g. `specify-route`) and a `prompt` naming the chosen route and the alternatives, so the operator confirms the routing **before** anything is scaffolded. When a candidate spec is `done`, the prompt names the `done → in-progress` back-edge accepting it implies, exactly as groom's per-item confirmation does. When the derivation reported no candidates and no skipped sources, say so and proceed — a fresh adopter sees one line, not a decision. When any source was **skipped**, report *could not derive candidates* and name the source: that is a different answer from *none found*, and stating it as the latter would claim a check ran that did not. Denial ends the run cleanly with nothing written, which is how the operator takes a candidate instead; the framework reports and does not veto, so creating a new spec over any candidate stays one keystroke away.

4. Invoke `create-feature` with the feature description from `$ARGUMENTS` as the title. The primitive computes the next feature number from the existing NNN-prefixed directories under the configured specs root, derives the kebab-case slug, creates `specs/{NNN-slug}/`, and copies the spec template into it atomically (mode-preserving); it resolves the template from `{specs-root}/templates/spec.md` and falls back to the framework source layout `framework/templates/spec/spec.md` (the ductus repo's own layout). An already-existing target directory is the `created: false` domain outcome — report the collision and stop rather than overwrite. With no ductus runtime registered, walk the markdown-only path below instead.

5. <!-- llm:writeSpecBody --> Fill the new spec body following §spec-requirements: a Motivation section, Acceptance Criteria with concrete and testable checkboxes (sparse acceptance criteria are valid for brownfield use — leave the section with a comment noting criteria will emerge from real work), Open Questions, and any inline links to other specs that .ductus/scripts/gen-spec-deps.sh will derive the frontmatter dependencies from. The host returns the markdown body for the new file; the walker forwards the response through the context.

6. Invoke `label-criteria` against the new feature to assign a stable `AC{n}:` label to every criterion the step above wrote, and to record `next-criterion` in the frontmatter. The initial batch is labelled in the run that created it, so a criterion can be cited by label in the same conversation that authored it — that is the moment citation matters most. The pass is idempotent and writes nothing when the section is empty, so a brownfield spec with a placeholder comment and no criteria is unaffected. **Never derive the label in the LLM**: picking `max + 1` means tallying the list, which is exactly the counting this labelling exists to remove.

7. Invoke `lint-markdown` against the new spec file to surface any markdown violations the LLM may have introduced. With no ductus runtime registered, run `npx markdownlint-cli2` per the markdown-only path.

8. Invoke `gate-confirm` with a `gate` name (e.g. `specify-create`) and a `prompt` asking the user to approve creating the new feature and setting it as the session target before any session-file write. `gate-confirm` is non-blocking — it returns the prompt payload (`gate`, `prompt`, `request-id`) and the host routes the decision out-of-band. On confirmation, continue to the session write below; on denial, the walker exits cleanly without writing the session.

9. Invoke `write-session` with the new feature slug and its repo-relative spec directory — under the configured `[paths] specs-root` (default `specs`; spec 040) — as the feature and path arguments. This is a target write: the primitive stamps a fresh set-at while preserving any cli-config-dir already in the file (the per-contributor agent identity written by `/ductus`), at `.ductus/session.toml`, through tempfile + rename atomic-write semantics. On the markdown-only path, the host writes the file by hand per the markdown-only reference's Write the session target section — the cli-config-dir preservation rule there applies verbatim.

## Markdown-only reference

The full new-feature-creation procedure (directory creation, template copy, frontmatter conventions, session write, and next-step prompt) is documented below for the markdown-only path. The numbered steps above invoke the mechanical primitives plus the writeSpecBody extension that automate the deterministic phases.

> **Spec-root resolution.** Every `specs/…` path below is written under the configured `[paths] specs-root` (default `specs`; spec 040, constitution §spec-phase). When `.ductus/config.toml` sets `[paths] specs-root`, substitute that name for the literal `specs/` throughout — the feature-number scan, the new feature directory, the `templates/spec.md` source, and the session `path`. The literal `specs/` is the documented default; the runtime primitives already resolve it, so only this markdown-only path performs the substitution by hand.

### Route before scaffolding

Run this **before** the feature directory exists — creating a spec is the one
action the routing rules exist to prevent, so a gate after the write is no gate
at all.

Derive the homes this work could already have (primitive:
`derive-routing-candidates`; by hand, read the three sources directly — no
shell-pipeline substitution):

1. **Runtime work.** Does the description name a runtime primitive or a path
   under `runtime/`? If so, the home is the spec whose `plan.md` lists a
   `runtime/` path under `## Affected Files` — **derived from the corpus, not
   assumed.** Each project's runtime-owning spec is its own; a project with
   none yields no candidate rather than a wrong one. The route is a scenario on
   that spec, via the back-edge.
2. **Rule surfaces.** Does the description share vocabulary with a rule file's
   category stem (`security-backend.md` → `security`, with the
   `-backend`/`-frontend`/`-cross` surface suffix set aside)? A rule belonging
   to an existing surface is amended on that surface's home spec, not spawned
   as a spec of its own.
3. **Spec corpus.** Does it share vocabulary with an existing spec's slug? Then
   it may be a scenario on that spec.

Then walk the **Groom decision tree** — the one in `groom.md`, which is its
single canonical statement — over the description in place of an inbox item,
with those candidates as evidence, and confirm the result with the user before
anything is written:

- **Candidates found** — name them, name the route each implies, and let the
  operator pick: a scenario on `NNN`, a rule-file amendment, or a new spec
  anyway. A new spec stays creatable over any candidate; this reports, it does
  not veto. When a named candidate is `done`, say that accepting it reopens it
  `done → in-progress`, so the operator consents to the back-edge before it
  happens — the same wording groom's per-item confirmation uses.
- **No candidates, nothing skipped** — say so in one line and proceed. Every
  source ran and matched nothing, so a new spec is the right answer. A fresh
  adopter with no rule files and a single-spec corpus is exactly this case and
  must see no new friction.
- **A source could not be examined** — report *could not derive candidates* and
  name the source and reason. This is **not** the same answer as *none found*
  (`QUAL-CLAIM-001`): an unreadable rule directory reported as "no candidates"
  tells the operator a new spec is correct on the strength of a check that
  never ran.

Skip this section entirely when the routing tree has already run for this work
— `/papur:groom` routing an item to `/papur:specify` is the case — and
say why. Asking a question that has been answered is friction, not rigor.

### Resolve feature number and slug

1. `$ARGUMENTS` is the feature description (e.g., "webhook delivery"). This is required — if empty, ask the user what feature to specify.
2. Determine the next available feature number by checking existing directories under `specs/` matching the NNN-feature pattern; the next number is the highest existing NNN plus one (zero-padded to three digits).
3. Generate the slug from the feature description: lowercase, hyphenated, no whitespace, no punctuation beyond hyphens.

### Create the feature directory

1. Create `specs/{NNN-feature-name}/`.
2. Copy `specs/templates/spec.md` into the directory as `spec.md`.

Both sections above are what the `create-feature` primitive automates on the runtime path (number scan, slug derivation, directory creation, atomic template copy); walk them by hand only when no runtime is available.

### Fill the spec body

Fill in the spec following `.ductus/constitution.md` rules (§spec-requirements, §text-first-artifacts):

- Frontmatter `status` starts at `draft` (template default); `dependencies` starts at `[]` and is generator-managed (do not author by hand).
- Describe behavior and contracts, not implementation.
- No language-specific code, function signatures, or package paths.
- Acceptance criteria must be concrete and testable when present. For brownfield use, sparse acceptance criteria are expected and valid — leave the section with a placeholder comment if no criteria are known yet; criteria emerge as real work touches the feature (§brownfield-process).
- List all open questions in the spec body.
- When the spec depends on other specs, link them inline in the body (e.g., `[NNN-feature](../NNN-feature/spec.md)`) — `.ductus/scripts/gen-spec-deps.sh` (run by the pre-commit hook) derives the `dependencies:` frontmatter from those links on every commit.

### Label the acceptance criteria

Assign each criterion its stable `AC{n}:` label, written between the checkbox and the criterion's text (`- [ ] AC7: …`), and record `next-criterion` in the frontmatter (primitive: `label-criteria`). A new spec starts at `AC1:` and numbers in body order; `next-criterion` is one past the last label assigned. Leave the section untouched when it holds no criteria — an absent `next-criterion` means "no labels assigned yet", which is a truthful state rather than a defect (§text-first-artifacts).

Write the label rather than leaving it to a later pass: the label is what a criterion is cited by, in prose, across specs, and by tooling, and a criterion discussed in the session that created it needs its identifier during that conversation. On this path the derivation is `max(highest label in body, next-criterion)` — never `max(body) + 1`, which would reissue the label of a criterion that has since been deleted. The rule is arithmetic, so both paths agree by construction (spec 013).

### Lint the new file

Run `npx markdownlint-cli2` on the new file (primitive: `lint-markdown`).

### Write the session target

Write `.ductus/session.toml` to set this feature as the session target (primitive: `write-session`, gated by `gate-confirm` above). First read any existing `.ductus/session.toml` to capture its cli-config-dir (the per-contributor agent identity written by /ductus) and carry it forward, so creating a new feature never drops the agent identity. Use tempfile + rename atomic-write semantics analogous to the runtime's spec write primitives.
