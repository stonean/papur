# Status

Display the pipeline view for all feature specs.

## Purpose

Read-only overview of every feature's progress through the pipeline. Shows which specs are ready to advance, which are blocked, and what the current session target is.

## Scope Boundaries

- This is a read-only command. Do NOT modify any files.
- The pipeline view is acquired through the single `dashboard` primitive — one runtime call returns the structured payload plus the pre-rendered pipeline view. On the runtime path the procedure does not read individual spec files, list directories, or shell out for that view; the markdown-only fallback (below) necessarily reads the artifacts on disk, but still without shell-pipeline substitution.
- Cross-service reference resolution is read-only and, on the runtime path, folded into that same call: the runtime resolves each spec's `references:` index internally (the same classification the resolve-references primitive exposes) to render the readout. On the markdown-only path the host reads `.ductus/config.toml` and the linked specs with host file tools (see the Resolving cross-service references section below). Both paths read only `.ductus/config.toml` and the registered local checkouts — the canonical repo URL is never fetched.
- Reference: §text-first-artifacts (the schema is the authoritative source for which fields appear in the payload); [030 — Cross-Service References](../../specs/030-cross-service-references/spec.md) for the reference semantics surfaced here.

## Instructions

> **For agent runtimes**: the Invoke steps below call the MCP tools of the ductus runtime; the host-integration contract — bare↔prefixed tool names, lazy ToolSearch schema fetch, the no-shell-utilities rule, and the two-paths guarantee — lives once in the constitution, §runtime-host-integration. Before the server is registered — the window between acquisition and the restart that loads it — walk the same prose using the host file-reading tools (Read, Edit, Write).
>
> **For this command specifically**: the single deterministic tool for the pipeline view is `dashboard`. One MCP call returns the session target, the per-spec inventory, the repo-wide tags-union, the `.ductus/config.toml` review-state summary, and the pre-rendered pipeline view. Do not substitute shell utilities (no `ls`, no `for` loops over spec directories, no `cat .ductus/config.toml`) for that call. Cross-service reference resolution for specs that carry a `references:` index is folded into the same call on the runtime path (the runtime resolves each index internally for the readout); on the markdown-only path, use the host file tools documented in the Resolving cross-service references section. Neither substitutes a shell pipeline.

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
1. Invoke `dashboard` to load the full pipeline state in one call. Alongside the structured payload (session-target, specs, tags-union, config), the result carries a `rendered-markdown` field: the preamble, dashboard table, counts and callouts, and cross-service references readout pre-rendered as one markdown fragment (the runtime resolves each spec's `references:` index internally for the readout, so no separate per-spec call is needed on this path).

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
1. Emit the `rendered-markdown` fragment as the pipeline view. It is returned data the host may restyle — do not recompute the underlying facts from the structured payload when the fragment is present. On the markdown-only path, derive the same facts with host file tools and render the four pieces by hand per the Rendering reference below.

<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
1. List any non-done specs (excluding the current target, if any) and prompt the user to run `/papur:target` to select one.

## Status → next action

| Status | Next Action |
| --- | --- |
| draft | /papur:clarify |
| clarified | /papur:plan |
| planned | /papur:implement |
| in-progress | /papur:implement |
| done | done (spec is complete) |

When a scenario is targeted and the scenario itself has one or more open questions, the next action is `/papur:clarify` (scenario-targeted, resolves scenario-level open questions regardless of parent spec status).

When a spec's `scenario-open-question-count` is at least one, its Next Action is `clarify (scenario)` at any status, including `done` — a spec is not complete while its scenarios carry questions (§spec-lifecycle). `clarify (recovery)` takes precedence when both apply: spec-body questions at `clarified` or later are the more upstream defect. The cell is exclusive; the callouts are not (see the Rendering reference).

When a spec declares `folds-into`, its Status cell is the frontmatter status **qualified** with the pending fold — `done (fold pending)`, `in-progress (fold pending)` — and its Next Action is `/papur:fold → {target}` at any status. A declared fold target is outstanding work, so the view never reports such a spec as simply `done`: a branch-scoped spec is retired by fold-back, not completed (§numbering, §spec-lifecycle). The status is kept beside the qualification rather than replaced by it, because `in-progress` and a hand-edited `done` are different situations for the operator even though both are held short of complete. Either `clarify` override above takes precedence over the fold — an open question is the more upstream defect, and content gets settled before it gets moved.

A fold target that does not resolve in this tree is called out on the same row (`… (target not in this tree)`). That is a **report, not a verdict**: before the merge the target normally lives on the branch this one forked from, so an unresolvable target is the expected state and only a typo is worth correcting. Existence is enforced at fold-back, which is the first tree in which both specs exist.

## Markdown-only reference

### Rendering reference

The `rendered-markdown` field carries these four pieces pre-rendered, in this order, blocks separated by blank lines. Without the runtime, derive the same facts with the host file tools (read each spec's frontmatter and body, `.ductus/session.toml`, and `.ductus/config.toml` directly — no shell-pipeline substitution; the field names below refer to the `dashboard` payload schema, whose values the markdown-only walk derives from the artifacts on disk) and render each piece as follows. Both paths produce the same view.

1. Render the **preamble line** above the table from the session-target field. When session-target is present: `Target: {feature} / {status} / next: {next-action}`. The `{status}` and `{next-action}` come from the matching per-spec entry in the `specs` array; the next action follows the Status → next action table above, with `clarify (recovery)` overriding when the status is in {clarified, planned, in-progress} and the open-question count is at least one. When a scenario is also targeted, append a second preamble line: `Scenario: {scenario} ({section}) — open-questions: {open-question-count}`, with the `{section}` and `{open-question-count}` taken from `session-target.scenario-detail`; when the scenario has at least one unresolved question, the next action is `/papur:clarify` (scenario-targeted) regardless of the parent spec's next action. When session-target is null, render `No session target. Run /papur:target to select one.`

2. Render the **dashboard table** with one row per entry in the `specs` array. Columns: Feature, Status, Plan, Tasks, Data-model, Scenarios, Dependencies, Next Action. Mark the row matching the session target by wrapping its Feature cell in bold (`| **{slug}** | … |`); when session-target is null, no row is bolded. The Plan/Tasks/Data-model cells show `✓` when the artifact exists and `—` otherwise. The Status cell shows the frontmatter status, suffixed with `(fold pending)` when the spec declares `folds-into` — the status is qualified, never replaced, so a spec held short of complete by an undischarged fold still says which status it is held at. The Scenarios column shows scenarios-count, suffixed with `({N} open)` after a space when the spec's `scenario-open-question-count` is at least one and rendered as the bare count otherwise — reusing the existing column keeps the glance table from growing a ninth one (spec 046). The Dependencies column shows the comma-separated three-digit NNN prefixes from `specs[].dependencies`, sorted ascending — `—` when the array is empty. The Next Action column comes from the Status → next action table above; when the status is in {clarified, planned, in-progress} and open-question-count is at least one, the Next Action is `clarify (recovery)` regardless of status — that recovery state usually arises from a manual frontmatter edit.

3. Below the table, render **counts and callouts**. Show counts per status level on one line, in lifecycle order (group the `specs` array by `status`): `Counts: {status} {N} · …`. Show the blocked specs callout when any entry has a non-empty blocked-by — `Blocked: {N} spec(s) — {comma-separated slugs}` (the slugs come from each blocked spec's `slug`, not its blocked-by). Show the recovery-state callout when any entry's status is in {clarified, planned, in-progress} with open-question-count ≥ 1: `{N} spec(s) in recovery state: {comma-separated slugs}. Run /papur:clarify on each to walk the questions; the spec reverts to draft and advances forward again.` Show the scenario-questions callout when any entry's `scenario-open-question-count` is at least one: `{total} unresolved scenario question(s) in {N} spec(s): {slug} ({comma-separated scenarios-with-questions}); …. Run /papur:target <feature>/<scenario> then /papur:clarify on each; a spec is not complete while its scenarios carry questions.` Name every affected spec and every carrying scenario — no cap, since a truncated list reads as "these are the ones that need attention" while hiding others; a table cell cannot hold scenario names, which is why this callout exists. This callout renders **independently** of the recovery callout: when a spec is in both states only the Next Action cell is exclusive, and suppressing this line would hide questions that still need resolving after the recovery walk. Show the outstanding-fold callout when any entry declares `folds-into`: `{N} spec(s) with an outstanding fold: {slug} → {target}; …. Run /papur:fold on each; a branch-scoped spec is retired by fold-back, not completed. A target reported as not in this tree is the normal state before the merge — it lives on the upstream branch — so correct it only when it is a typo.` A target that does not resolve here is suffixed `(not in this tree)` on its own entry. This callout is independent of the two above for the same reason they are independent of each other, and it collects into one line the backlog the row-level qualification states one row at a time. Show the tags-in-use line when tags-union is non-empty: `tags: {comma-separated}`; skip the line entirely otherwise. Show the disabled-rule-files line when `config.present` is true and `config.disabled-rule-files` is non-empty: `disabled rule files: {N} ({config-file}) — {comma-separated basenames}`, where `{config-file}` is the repo-relative resolved config file (`.ductus/config.toml`, or `.govern/config.toml` / the legacy root `.govern.toml` on a pre-migration layout); skip the line entirely when `config.present` is false or the array is empty. Reasons are not surfaced — they live in `.ductus/config.toml`; the dashboard is a glance, not a full pretty-printer.

4. Render the **cross-service references readout** for every spec whose derived `references` index is non-empty. Resolve each reference with the procedure in the Resolving cross-service references section below (folded into the `dashboard` call on the runtime path; host file tools on the markdown-only path), then list each reference beneath its spec as `{service}/{spec}` with its resolution outcome: on **ok**, the linked lifecycle status (e.g., `api/003-user → done`); on **unregistered**, `status not attempted` plus a pointer to `/papur:link` to register the service; on **not checked out** or **status unreadable**, `unknown` with the distinguishing reason; on **broken**, the broken-reference notice that `/papur:analyze` also reports. Append the matched service's `description` for orientation when one is present. Omit the readout entirely when no spec declares references — a single-service adopter sees no change.

### Resolving cross-service references

A spec's derived `references:` frontmatter index records each cross-service reference as a `{service, spec}` pair (see [030 — Cross-Service References](../../specs/030-cross-service-references/spec.md)). On the runtime path the `resolve-references` primitive classifies each entry; when the runtime is unavailable, classify each entry with the host's file tools — read `.ductus/config.toml` and the linked spec directly, with **no shell-pipeline substitution**. The repo URL is identity and navigation only and is **never fetched**; status is read from the local checkout.

For each `{service, spec}` entry, in index order, decide the outcome by what can be proven:

1. **`unregistered`** — the entry's `service` is null, or names an alias absent from `.ductus/config.toml` `[services]`. Status not attempted; a plain navigational link, not an error. (Surface it with a pointer to `/papur:link` to register the service.)
2. Otherwise read the matched `[services.<alias>]` entry's local `path` (relative to the repo root, or absolute):
   - **`not-checked-out`** — `path` is missing or is not a directory. Status `unknown`; informational, never reported as broken — nothing can be proven without a checkout.
   - Otherwise resolve the target spec at `{path}/{linked-specs-root}/{spec}/spec.md`, where `{linked-specs-root}` is the **linked service's own** `[paths] specs-root` (default `specs`) read from the checkout's `.ductus/config.toml` — each service may configure its own spec root, and `resolve-references` honors the linked repo's setting, so the markdown-only path must read it too rather than assuming `specs/`:
     - **`broken`** — the target file does not exist (renamed, moved, deleted, or mistyped upstream). A provable defect, surfaced by `/papur:analyze`.
     - Otherwise read the target's frontmatter `status`:
       - **`status-unreadable`** — the file has no frontmatter, its frontmatter is not valid YAML, or `status` is missing or not one of `draft` / `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` / `done`. Status `unknown`; surfaced, the defect is upstream's.
       - **`ok`** — `status` is present and in that allowed set. The record carries that lifecycle status.

This host-tools procedure produces the same resolution records — `{service, spec, outcome, status}` — as the `resolve-references` primitive for the same inputs; the two paths share a contract and neither wraps the other.

**Surfacing in `/papur:status`.** The readout render step lists one line per reference beneath its spec: the resolution `outcome` and, on `ok`, the linked lifecycle `status`. The matched `[services.<alias>]` entry's `description` — read from the same `.ductus/config.toml` the resolution consults — is appended for orientation when present (informational only; no rendering branches on it, so a blank description degrades to nothing). An `unregistered` reference is surfaced with a pointer to `/papur:link` so the user can register the service; `not-checked-out` and `status-unreadable` surface as `unknown` with their distinguishing reason; a `broken` reference is surfaced here and is the same provable defect `/papur:analyze` reports as an Advisory finding.
