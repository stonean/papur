description: Add a question or a scenario to the targeted spec (classifier-driven).
argument-hint: "[input text]"
---

# Amend

Add input to the targeted spec or scenario. `/amend` classifies the input as a **question** (an unresolved decision recorded under `## Open Questions`), a **scenario** (a concrete behavior captured under `scenarios/{slug}.md`), or a **criterion** (a testable requirement recorded under `## Acceptance Criteria`), routes through the matching path, and on the spec target performs whichever back-edge keeps the lifecycle invariant.

## Purpose

Captures additions to a spec that arise at any point in the pipeline — during review, planning, implementation, or just thinking. `/amend` is the single verb for "I have a thing to add to this spec." The framework classifies the input and routes it; the user approves the classification (or flips it) at the same approval gate that already exists for the refined wording.

The back-edges that keep the spec lifecycle honest are owned by `/amend`:

- **Question route — `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` → `draft`.** Recording a new open question on a non-`draft` spec leaves the spec in an internally inconsistent state ("status says questions resolved, body has unresolved questions"); the same write reverts status to `draft`. The user's acceptance of the refined question at the approval gate is the consent for the mutation; no separate prompt fires.
- **Scenario route — `done` → `in-progress`.** Recording a scenario on a `done` spec reopens it via the documented reopen cycle (§spec-lifecycle). The scenario's task is implemented, the spec returns to `done`.
- **Criterion route — `done` → `in-progress`.** Recording a new acceptance criterion on a `done` spec reopens it. This adds **no new edge**: §spec-lifecycle's third back-edge already covers a *meaningful body edit*, and a new criterion is new scope, so it takes that edge "via the same `/amend` flow used for scenarios". The criterion is appended unlabelled and the label assigned by `label-criteria` — never by hand, since the assignment is `max(highest label in body, next-criterion)` and a hand-written guess collides with a retired label eventually. On a spec below `done` the criterion is recorded with no status change: `clarified` and later already tolerate criteria, and only `done` asserts they are all verified.

  Why this route belongs here rather than on `/papur:clarify`: clarify is the resolver, not the back-edge entry point (spec 014), and its `draft` gate is load-bearing. `/amend` already classifies an input and performs the matching mutation, so a third route extends a surface that exists instead of widening a gate that was narrowed deliberately. See [000's `criterion-route-after-draft`](../../specs/000-slash-commands/scenarios/criterion-route-after-draft.md) for the full reasoning.

## Context

Use the session target from `.ductus/session.toml`. If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the initial input text. If no session target is set and no arguments provided, stop and tell the user to run `/papur:target` first.

## Target File Detection

Read `.ductus/session.toml`. If the session includes a `scenario` and `scenario-path`, the target artifact is the scenario file and the input is always treated as a question (scenarios do not nest under scenarios; the classifier is bypassed). Otherwise, the target artifact is the feature's `spec.md`. If that file does not exist, stop and report: "Spec does not exist. Run `/papur:specify` first."

## Scope Boundaries

- This command reads the target artifact, appends to its `## Open Questions` section or writes a new `scenarios/{slug}.md` file and appends a linked task to `tasks.md`, and — when a back-edge applies — updates the spec's frontmatter `status` field. No other artifact contents are modified. Plan files and source code are never read or written.
- Spec `status` is read from the YAML frontmatter at the top of the file. It is mutated by this command only on a back-edge (clarified+ → draft or done → in-progress).
- For the impact display, this command may read sibling specs' frontmatter (only) under `specs/` to detect dependents. It does not read sibling spec bodies.
- For the re-open precondition and the reconcile pass, this command may run `git status --porcelain` scoped to the feature directory to detect uncommitted scenario/task edits. It does not read the diff bodies or run any other git command. The reconcile pass additionally reads `specs/{feature}/tasks.md` to find the tasks referencing each candidate scenario, and appends a task there on confirmation; it never reads or rewrites the scenario bodies.
- Reference: §spec-requirements, §spec-lifecycle, §scenarios, §text-first-artifacts, §bug-handling, §spec-phase (spec-root resolution) (constitution loaded by `/papur:target` — do not re-read).

## Instructions

> **For agent runtimes**: the Invoke steps below call the MCP tools of the ductus runtime; the host-integration contract — bare↔prefixed tool names, lazy ToolSearch schema fetch, the no-shell-utilities rule, and the two-paths guarantee — lives once in the constitution, §runtime-host-integration. Before the server is registered — the window between acquisition and the restart that loads it — walk the same prose using the host file-reading tools (Read, Edit, Write).

### Confirm target

1. Read `.ductus/session.toml` to get the session target's feature and optional scenario.
2. Read the target artifact (scenario file if targeted, otherwise `spec.md`).
3. **Recompute dependencies (safety net).** If the target is a spec, invoke `derive-dependencies` (the report-only default — it never writes without `--write`; it walks every spec, there is no per-spec mode). When it reports drift, the `dependencies:` frontmatter is stale from uncommitted body edits; surface that and recommend committing (the pre-commit hook syncs it) or running `ductus derive-dependencies --write` manually. Do **not** pass `--write` here: this command's writes are limited to the target's questions/scenario/task/status and the session file (see Scope Boundaries), while a writing run rewrites `dependencies:` across every spec. The pre-commit hook normally keeps this in sync; this step catches uncommitted body edits. (Skip on scenario targets — scenarios have no `dependencies` field.)
4. If the target is a spec, read its frontmatter `status` field now — the value is needed for the gate, the impact display, the classifier's status tiebreaker, and the post-record mutation.
5. Display the feature name, scenario name (if targeted), status, and a brief summary of what the artifact covers.

### Re-open precondition and reconcile pass (spec target)

Before gathering input, inspect the feature directory for an on-disk delta. Two things ride on that delta. The user may have already added scenario or task content informally (during conversation, manual editing, etc.) and only need the status flipped to match — there is no new input to classify. And a scenario added by hand carries **no task**: no other route in the command surface appends one, so the **reconcile pass** below offers it here. Detection is a host responsibility; the mutations use the `set-status` and append-task primitives when registered. Scenario-targeted `/papur:amend` skips this section (scenarios have no status field).

Which half runs depends on status and input:

- **Status flip** — `done` specs only, as before.
- **Reconcile pass** — `done`, `planned`, and `in-progress` specs, and only when the invocation carries no input. With `$ARGUMENTS` supplied the user has something specific to add and the classifier owns the turn.
- **`draft` / `clarified`** — both halves skip. `/papur:plan` regenerates `tasks.md` from the plan, and the pass must not fight the forward path.

1. Run `git status --porcelain -- specs/{feature}/scenarios/ specs/{feature}/spec.md specs/{feature}/tasks.md` and parse the output. The delta consists of:
   - Untracked files under `specs/{feature}/scenarios/` (status `??`).
   - Modified `specs/{feature}/spec.md` or `specs/{feature}/tasks.md` (any porcelain status code with `M` in either the index column or the working-tree column).
2. If the delta is empty, emit one line naming what went unexamined, then continue to **Gather the input**. Silence here would read as "every scenario under this spec has a task", which the pass has no basis to claim — it examined none of them:

   ```text
   reconcile: no uncommitted scenario or task edits — {N} scenario(s) under this spec were not examined
   ```

   Omit the line when the feature has no `scenarios/` directory or no scenario files: there is no subject, so there is nothing to overstate.
<!-- audit:ignore-promotion -->
3. **Reconcile pass.** For each scenario file in the delta, read `specs/{feature}/tasks.md` and collect **every** task referencing that scenario — checked and unchecked alike. A task references the scenario when the **slug appears in the task's heading, in a subtask line, or in its `Done when` clause**; this is a slug match, not a path match, so a hand-written task naming the scenario without the `scenarios/{slug}.md` path counts. That rule is not new here — it is the one `/papur:analyze`'s `scenario-consistency` family already applies, and it is canonical there (see [§drift-prevention](../../framework/constitution.md#drift-prevention)'s canonical-source map). Both surfaces MUST answer "does a task reference this scenario?" the same way or the reconcile pass will offer a duplicate for a scenario the family considers mapped. The checkbox state selects the prompt, never whether to look; deciding from the unchecked set alone would append blind to a scenario that already carries a completed task.
   - **A pending (unchecked) referencing task exists** — skip the scenario silently. The work is already queued, and the contributor working that task reads the updated scenario body; a second task would double-count it.
   - **Only completed (checked) referencing tasks exist** — offer, naming them. A checked task means "was implemented", which the new behavior has just invalidated, so it is not evidence against offering — but the operator decides with the existing tasks in view.
   - **No referencing task at all** — offer plainly.

   Prompt **per scenario**, never batched into one accept-all — each is a separate judgment about whether the scenario describes unimplemented work:

   ```text
   scenarios/{slug}.md has no pending task.
     task {N} ({title}) references it and is complete     ← omitted when no task references it
   Append a task for it{, reopening the spec to `in-progress`}?
   ```

   On **confirm**, append the task with the append-task primitive, passing the scenario's `slug` and omitting `body` so the default `Implement the behavior described in scenarios/{slug}.md` line renders — the same shape the scenario route writes, so the `scenario-consistency` family reads the linkage identically whichever route produced it. Per-scenario arguments are host-supplied, so this call is host work rather than a walker-dispatched step. On **decline**, write nothing and move to the next candidate. The scenario file itself is never created, renamed, duplicated, or rewritten.

   When the pass finishes without offering anything, say what it examined rather than going quiet — the same reason step 2 does:

   ```text
   reconcile: examined {N} scenario(s) in the delta; each already has a pending task
   ```

4. When the reconcile pass appended at least one task to a `done` spec, invoke `set-status` with `from: done`, `to: in-progress` as part of that same action — the prompt in step 3 named the reopen, so it is already consented (§spec-lifecycle, the scenario back-edge). Skip step 5's prompt in that case; the status already reflects the delta. On a `planned` or `in-progress` spec no status mutation occurs.
5. If no task was appended and the status is `done`, display the prior status (`done`) and each delta path with its filesystem mtime, then prompt:

   ```text
   Spec is `done` but the feature directory has un-tracked scenario or task edits:
     {path-1}  ({untracked|modified}, mtime {ts})
     {path-2}  ({untracked|modified}, mtime {ts})
     ...
   Revert status to `in-progress` to reflect the on-disk delta?
   ```

6. On **confirm**, invoke `set-status` with `from: done`, `to: in-progress` to flip the frontmatter. Otherwise, edit the frontmatter directly. Display: "Spec reopened to `in-progress`. The on-disk delta is now tracked. Run `/papur:plan` or `/papur:implement` next." Exit without entering the classifier and without recording any new input.
7. On **decline**, continue to **Gather the input** without modifying any file. The spec remains `done` and the on-disk delta is left alone. If the user has new content to add (the delta is forward-looking and not what they're capturing now), it routes through the existing classifier; if they have nothing more, the Gather step exits naturally. The user can also re-invoke `/papur:amend` later to accept the re-open.

The status-flip prompt offers an opt-out so the user can decline and continue into the scenario branch with a new input — useful when the delta represents forward-looking work the user does *not* want to reflect in the spec's status yet. Declining a reconcile offer is likewise not recorded: the same candidate is offered on the next invocation while it remains in the delta, since no artifact holds per-scenario decline state.

Scope note: the delta above is the working-tree definition this command has always used, so a **committed** hand-added scenario is not a candidate — which is what step 2's line reports rather than leaving implied. Widening that signal, and the matching `/papur:analyze` detection, is upstream framework work; this section consumes whatever delta is defined for it rather than defining a second one. Nothing here distinguishes a scenario documenting already-shipped behavior from one describing unimplemented work, which is why every offer is a prompt: the operator is the discriminator until a mechanical one exists.

### Gather the input

If `$ARGUMENTS` is provided, use it as the initial input. Otherwise, ask the user: "What do you want to add to this spec?"

When a scenario is the target artifact, skip the classifier (next section) — scenarios accept questions only, not nested scenarios. Continue directly to **Refine the input (question route)**.

### Classify the input

Apply the heuristic to route the input. The classification is provisional — the user can flip it at the approval gate.

**Question signals (route → question):**

- The input ends with `?`.
- The input starts with an interrogative: `how`, `what`, `when`, `should`, `could`, `would`, `is`, `are`, `do`, `does`, `can`, `which`, `why`, `who`.
- The input contains hedge words: `maybe`, `perhaps`, `not sure`, `unclear`, `unsure`.

**Scenario signals (route → scenario):**

- Declarative or imperative phrasing: `when X happens, Y`; `X must Y`; `X should do Y` (without `?`).
- Concrete event/state language: `on`, `when`, `if`, `after`, `during`, `before`.
- No terminal `?`; no interrogative starter.

**Status tiebreaker:** when signals are mixed or absent on a **`done` spec**, default to scenario (the back-edge from `done` is owned by the scenario path; the question path refuses on `done`). When signals are mixed on any other status, default to question.

### Refine the input (question route)

The goal is a question that is precise, actionable, and self-contained — someone reading it during `/papur:clarify` should understand exactly what needs to be decided without extra context.

1. **Understand intent** — read the target artifact to understand how the question relates to its behaviors, contracts, acceptance criteria, or open areas. If the question's connection to the artifact is unclear, ask the user to explain how it applies.
2. **Draft a refined version** — rewrite the question so it is specific to the spec's domain and terminology, identifies which behavior or criterion it affects, states what decision or information is needed, and stands alone.
3. **Check for duplicates** — compare against entries already in the target artifact's `## Open Questions` section. Use a normalized-whitespace comparison (collapse runs of whitespace, trim, case-insensitive). If the refined form matches an existing entry, report: "An equivalent question is already recorded: '{existing entry}'. Skip or refine further?" On skip, exit without recording; on refine further, incorporate feedback and loop.

### Refine the input (scenario route)

The goal is a scenario that captures a specific situation and the concrete behavior it triggers. Scenarios live at a lower level of abstraction than the parent spec — narrower scope, plain language.

1. **Walk the bug decision tree** (§bug-handling):
   - **Does a spec exist for the behavior?** If no, stop. Tell the user to create the spec first via `/papur:specify`, then come back. (`/amend` requires a session target with a real spec file.)
   - **Is the spec ambiguous or incomplete?** If yes — the right fix is to update the spec directly, not record a scenario. Offer to help edit the spec; exit without recording.
   - **Is this a chore rather than a spec addition?** If the input is project maintenance (lint or formatting cleanup, dependency cleanup, repo hygiene, a standalone refactor) that adds no durable requirement and is not really about this spec (§bug-handling, durability test) — it is not spec material. Do not write a scenario or touch the spec; tell the user to capture it with `/papur:log` (it lives in the inbox as a chore, done directly). Exit without recording.
   - **Is the spec clear but the behavior needs lower-level elaboration?** Proceed to draft the scenario.
2. **Derive a slug** — lowercase, hyphenated, no whitespace, no punctuation beyond hyphens. Check `specs/{feature}/scenarios/` for slug conflicts; if a file with that slug exists, ask the user for a different name.
3. **Identify the parent-spec section** — the `section:` frontmatter value names the spec section the scenario elaborates. Read the spec's body to pick an appropriate section, or ask the user.
4. **Draft Context, Behavior, and (optional) Edge Cases** for the scenario — plain language; Given/When/Then syntax is not required.

### Approval gate (both routes)

Show the user:

```text
Recording as [question|scenario] — preview drafted at [`## Open Questions` entry | `scenarios/{slug}.md`].

{preview of the refined content}

Accept this form, refine further, or `flip` to switch route?
```

- **Accept** → proceed to **Record the input**.
- **Refine further** → incorporate feedback, redraft, re-present.
- **`flip`** → switch the classification to the other route. Discard the current refined draft. Re-enter the appropriate **Refine the input** section under the new route. The flip keyword is recognized only as a standalone command at this prompt — text that includes "flip" mid-sentence as part of a refined question or scenario is recognized as user-provided content via the existing approve/refine selector, not as the override keyword. **On a `done` spec, `flip` toward the question route is rejected** — a `done` spec has no question back-edge (§spec-lifecycle: it reopens only by recording a scenario), so the only route offered is scenario. Reject with: "A `done` spec accepts only scenarios — `flip` to the question route is unavailable. Reopen the spec first (record a scenario, or reflect an on-disk delta) to raise open questions." This keeps `append-question` from ever being called on a `done` spec, matching the primitive (which appends without reverting a `done` status).

The user's acceptance at this gate is the consent for any status mutation that follows. Do not prompt again for the back-edge.

### Impact display (spec target, question route, status ∈ {clarified, planned, in-progress})

When the question route is recording on a non-`draft` spec, display the impact before performing the write:

- The spec's prior status (the value that will be reverted from).
- Existence and last-modified timestamp of `plan.md`, `tasks.md`, and `data-model.md` in the feature directory. Omit files that do not exist.
- The list of files in `specs/{feature}/scenarios/` if that directory exists.
- A one-line dependency note when this spec is named in any other spec's frontmatter `dependencies` field. Scan sibling specs' frontmatter only (no body reads). When matches exist, render: "Note: this spec is a dependency of {comma-separated dependent slugs}; their pipeline checks will block until this spec returns to `clarified`."

This display is informational only — the user's prior acceptance is the consent.

### Impact display (spec target, scenario route, status = done)

When the scenario route is recording on a `done` spec, display the reopen impact:

- The spec's prior status (`done`, which will revert to `in-progress`).
- The new scenario's path: `scenarios/{slug}.md`.
- A note that the scenario adds a task to `tasks.md` and must be implemented before the spec returns to `done`.

Informational; no separate confirmation prompt.

### Record the input

**Question route:**

1. Invoke `append-question` with the accepted question against the targeted feature — pass the scenario slug when a scenario is the session target. The primitive appends the `- {question}` bullet to the target artifact's `## Open Questions` section (creating a missing section per template order, replacing a `*None …*` scaffold placeholder), re-checks the normalized-whitespace dedup as a final guard (an equivalent existing entry suppresses the write and is reported back as `duplicate-of`), and on a spec target whose status is `clarified`, `planned`, or `in-progress` performs the `→ draft` back-edge in the same atomic write. Scenario targets never mutate status. On the markdown-only path, apply the same rules with the host's file tools: append the question to `## Open Questions` (creating the section in the appropriate location per the template if absent), and — if the target is a spec with status `clarified`, `planned`, or `in-progress` — update the frontmatter `status` field to `draft` in the same write.
2. Run `npx markdownlint-cli2` on the modified file (primitive: `lint-markdown`, MCP: `lint-markdown`).

**Scenario route:**

1. Invoke `create-scenario` to write `specs/{feature}/scenarios/{slug}.md` with the accepted `section` and the assembled `body` — the `## Context` … `## Edge Cases` markdown passed as one payload (per the content-ingestion convention; the section split is authored in-context, not as separate params). The primitive frames it with the `section:` frontmatter, the H1-from-slug, and the Open / Resolved Questions scaffolding (this framing is compiled into the primitive, mirroring `framework/templates/spec/scenario.md` — it does not read the template file), creates the `scenarios/` subdirectory if absent, and refuses on slug conflict.
2. Invoke `append-task` with the new scenario's `slug` to append a numbered task block to `specs/{feature}/tasks.md`. Pass `slug` and omit `body`: `append-task` **requires** `slug` when `body` is omitted (it refuses with a missing-argument error if both are absent) and renders the default body from it — a single checkbox ``- [ ] Implement the behavior described in `scenarios/{slug}.md` `` with the done-when condition "the scenario's described behavior is correctly implemented and tested."
3. If the spec's `status` is `done`, invoke `set-status` to flip `done → in-progress`. (For other spec statuses, no status mutation occurs.) Otherwise, edit the frontmatter directly.
4. Invoke `write-session` to set the new scenario as the session target: pass the feature slug as the feature argument, the repo-relative spec directory as the path argument, the new scenario slug as the scenario argument, and `specs/{feature}/scenarios/{slug}.md` as the scenario-path argument. The primitive performs a target write: it rewrites `.ductus/session.toml` atomically (tempfile + rename), preserving any cli-config-dir already in the file (the per-contributor agent identity written by /ductus). On the markdown-only path, first read any existing `.ductus/session.toml` to capture its cli-config-dir, then rewrite the TOML directly with top-level keys `feature`, `path`, `scenario`, `scenario-path`, `set-at` (ISO 8601 UTC), then the preserved cli-config-dir, through the same tempfile + rename pattern.
5. Invoke `lint-markdown` on every modified file.

### Status mutation summary

| Target | Prior status | Route | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Spec | `draft` | question | Append question only. No status mutation. |
| Spec | `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` | question | Show impact display, append question, revert `status` to `draft` in the same write. |
| Spec | `done` | question | Not reachable. The tiebreaker routes a `done` spec to scenario, and `flip` toward the question route is rejected on `done` — a `done` spec has no question back-edge, it reopens via a scenario. (`append-question` is never called on a `done` spec; were it called directly, it appends the question and leaves the status at `done`.) |
| Spec | `draft` / `clarified` / `planned` / `in-progress` | scenario | Show reopen-not-needed impact (the spec is already accepting work), create scenario, append task, update session target. No status mutation. |
| Spec | `done` | scenario | Show reopen impact, create scenario, append task, revert `status` to `in-progress` in the same write, update session target. |
| Spec | any | chore (scenario-route guard) | Not spec material — redirect the user to `/papur:log` and exit. No question, scenario, task, or status mutation. |
| Spec | `done` (on-disk delta, user confirms re-open precondition) | (precondition) | Flip `status` to `in-progress` via `set-status` (otherwise, edit the frontmatter directly). No question, no scenario, no task — the existing on-disk edits already capture the work. |
| Spec | `done` (no input, delta scenario with no pending task, user confirms the offer) | (reconcile) | Append a task for the existing scenario via `append-task` and flip `status` to `in-progress` in the same action. No new scenario file, no question; the scenario body is untouched. |
| Spec | `planned` / `in-progress` (same offer confirmed) | (reconcile) | Append the task only. No status mutation — the spec already accepts work. |
| Spec | `draft` / `clarified` | (reconcile) | Not reached. `/papur:plan` regenerates `tasks.md` from the plan, so the pass does not run. |
| Scenario | (no status field) | (forced question) | Append question to the scenario's Open Questions section. The parent spec's status is not read or mutated. |

### Prompt for another

Ask: "Do you have another input to add?" If yes, loop back to **Gather the input**. The mutation rules apply per input — once a spec has reverted to `draft` or reopened to `in-progress`, subsequent inputs in the same session just append.

When the user is done, display the next step:

- If a question was recorded on a spec: "Question recorded. Run `/papur:clarify` to resolve it." On a spec, the status is now `draft` regardless of where it started.
- If a question was recorded on a scenario: "Question recorded. Run `/papur:clarify` to resolve it." The parent spec's status is unchanged.
- If a scenario was recorded: "Scenario recorded at `specs/{feature}/scenarios/{slug}.md` and set as the session target. Run `/papur:implement` to work on the new task."
- If the input was a chore: "That's general maintenance, not a spec addition — capture it with `/papur:log`." Nothing was recorded on the spec.
- If the user aborted before accepting any input, exit silently — no input was recorded and no status mutation occurred.
