# Regenerate frontmatter `dependencies:` for every feature spec from
# inline body links to sibling specs.
#
# Walks specs/NNN-*/spec.md and specs/NNN-*/spec-and-plan.md, finds inline
# markdown links matching ](../NNN-slug/...) or ](specs/NNN-slug/...) that
# are outside fenced code blocks, outside blockquote-prefixed lines
# (signposts on done specs use blockquotes; their forward-pointer links
# are not implement-time dependencies), and outside any `## See also`
# section (informational/navigational pointers — author opt-out for links
# that should not induce a dependency edge; the opt-out ends at the next
# heading at level 2 or shallower; `## References` is NOT an opt-out and
# continues to produce edges), computes the union of unique sibling slugs,
# and rewrites the YAML frontmatter `dependencies:` field as a sorted YAML
# list. If a spec body has no such links the field becomes `[]`. Self-links
# are recorded (not stripped) so the cycle check below surfaces them.
#
# After the rewrite, runs an SCC-based cycle check across the derived dep
# graph. Any cycle — including self-cycles — is reported on stderr as
# `cycle: a -> b -> ... -> a` and the script exits non-zero. The pre-commit
# hooks propagate the failure to block the commit.
#
# Body inline links are authoritative; the frontmatter is a derived index.
