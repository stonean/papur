#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Regenerate frontmatter `references:` for every feature spec from inline
# body links to cross-service specs (absolute canonical-repo URLs).
#
# Walks tracked specs/NNN-*/spec.md (and spec-and-plan.md), finds inline
# markdown links whose href is an absolute http(s) URL pointing at another
# govern project's spec (a `/<spec-root>/NNN-slug/spec.md` path, where the
# <spec-root> segment is the referenced service's own spec-root name — see
# "Root-aware matching" below), outside fenced code blocks, outside
# blockquote-prefixed lines, and outside any `## See also`
# section (the same navigational opt-out gen-spec-deps.sh honors). Each such
# link is harvested into the derived `references:` frontmatter index, keyed
# {service, spec}:
#
#   * spec    — the `NNN-slug` segment of the URL (the stable identity).
#   * service — the URL's repo (everything before any `/blob/<ref>/` or
#               `/tree/<ref>/` branch segment, which is ignored) matched
#               against `.govern.toml` [services]. A matched repo records the
#               service alias; an unmatched repo records `service: null` (the
#               `unregistered` outcome, surfaced later at resolution time).
#
# Root-aware matching (scenario referenced-service-spec-root). The <spec-root>
# segment is NOT hardcoded to `specs`: a referenced service may rename its own
# spec root (spec 040). Two tiers, decided per registered service:
#   * Checkout reachable — the service is registered in [services] and its
#     local `path` resolves; the matcher reads that checkout's own .govern.toml
#     [paths] specs-root (default `specs`) and accepts only that exact segment.
#   * Checkout unreachable — a registered service that is not checked out, or
#     an unregistered repo, has an unknowable root, so the matcher accepts any
#     single [A-Za-z0-9_-] segment (the `/spec.md` anchor keeps an owner/repo
#     pair that looks like NNN-slug from false-matching). The reference is
#     still harvested, so it never silently drops from the index.
#
# The branch ref is never part of identity, so two links differing only in
# branch resolve to the same reference. `references:` is absent-when-empty:
# a spec with no cross-service links carries no field, and a stale block is
# removed when its last link is deleted.
#
# This index is kept strictly distinct from `dependencies:` — the generator
# never reads or writes that field. Sibling `../NNN-slug/` links are relative,
# never match the absolute-URL predicate, and stay the exclusive domain of
# gen-spec-deps.sh. Body inline links are authoritative; the frontmatter is a
# derived index.
